PREFACE.
</a>
</h3>
<p>
The arrogance of attempting a parody on the most ancient and sublime poem in the Inspired Volume, is not mine. The great pleasure enjoyed in its perusal from early years, had occasionally prompted metrical imitations of isolated passages. These fragmentary effusions, recently woven together, are here presented, with the hope that as wandering streams are traced to their original fountain, some heart may thus be led to the history of the stricken and sustained Patriarch, with more studious research, purer delight, or a deeper spirit of devotion.

<span class="sc">
A joyous festival</span>.&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i16">
The gathering back
</p>
<p>
Of scattered flowrets to the household wreath.
</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters from their sever'd homes
</p>
<p>
Meeting with ardent smile, to renovate
</p>
<p>
The love that sprang from cradle memories
</p>
<p>
And childhood's sports, and whose perennial stream
</p>
<p>
Still threw fresh crystals o'er the sands of life.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;Each bore some treasured picture of the past,
</p>
<p>
Some graphic incident, by mellowing time
</p>
<p>
Made beautiful, while ever and anon,
</p>
<p>
Timbrel and harp broke forth, each pause between.
</p>
<p>
Banquet and wine-cup, and the dance, gave speed
</p>
<p>
To youthful spirits, and prolong'd the joy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="poem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The patriarch father, with a chasten'd heart
</p>
<p>
Partook his children's mirth, having God's fear
</p>
<p>
Ever before him. Earnestly he brought
</p>
<p>
His offerings and his prayers for every one
</p>
<p>
Of that beloved group, lest in the swell
</p>
<p>
And surging superflux of happiness
</p>
<p>
They might forget the Hand from whence it came,
</p>
<p>
Perchance, displease the Almighty.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Many a care
</p>
<p>
Had he that wealth creates. Not such as lurks
</p>
<p>
In heaps metallic, which the rust corrodes,
</p>
<p>
But wealth that fructifies within the earth
</p>
<p>
Whence cometh bread, or o'er its surface roves
</p>
<p>
In peaceful forms of quadrupedal life
</p>
<p>
That thronging round the world's first father came
</p>
<p>
To take their names, 'mid Eden's tranquil shades,
</p>
<p>
Ere sin was born.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Obedient to the yoke,
</p>
<p>
Five hundred oxen turn'd the furrow'd glebe
</p>
<p>
Where agriculture hides his buried seed
</p>
<p>
Waiting the harvest hope, while patient wrought
</p>
<p>
An equal number of that race who share
</p>
<p>
The labor of the steed, without his praise.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;Three thousand camels, with their arching necks,
</p>
<p>
Ships of the desert, knelt to do his will,
</p>
<p>
And bear his surplus wealth to distant climes,
</p>
<p>
While more than twice three thousand snowy sheep
</p>
<p>
Whitened the hills. Troops of retainers fed
</p>
<p>
These flocks and herds, and their subsistence drew
</p>
<p>
From the same lord,&#8212;so that this man of Uz
</p>
<p>
Greater than all the magnates of the east,
</p>
<p>
Dwelt in old time before us.
</p>
<p class="i16">
True he gave,
</p>
<p>
And faithfully, the hireling his reward,
</p>
<p>
Counting such justice 'mid the happier forms
</p>
<p>
Of Charity, which with a liberal hand
</p>
<p>
He to the sad and suffering poor dispensed.
</p>
<p>
Eyes was he to the blind, and to the lame
</p>
<p>
Feet, while the stranger and the traveller found
</p>
<p>
Beneath, the welcome shelter of his roof
</p>
<p>
The blessed boon of hospitality.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To him the fatherless and widow sought
</p>
<p>
For aid and counsel. Fearlessly he rose
</p>
<p>
For those who had no helper. His just mind
</p>
<p>
Brought stifled truth to light, disarm'd the wiles
</p>
<p>
Of power, and gave deliverance to the weak.
</p>
<p>
He pluck'd the victim from the oppressor's grasp,
</p>
<p>
And made the tyrant tremble.
</p>
<p class="i16">
To his words
</p>
<p>
Men listened, as to lore oracular,
</p>
<p>
And when beside the gate he took his seat
</p>
<p>
The young kept silence, and the old rose up
</p>
<p>
To do him honor. After his decree
</p>
<p>
None spake again, for as a prince he dwelt
</p>
<p>
Wearing the diadem of righteousness,
</p>
<p>
And robed in that respect which greatness wins
</p>
<p>
When leagued with goodness, and by wisdom crown'd.
</p>
<p>
The grateful prayers and blessings of the souls
</p>
<p>
Ready to perish, silently distill'd
</p>
<p>
Upon him, as he slept.
</p>
<p class="i16">
So as a tree
</p>
<p>
Whose root is by the river's brink, he grew
</p>
<p>
And flourish'd, while the dews like balm-drops hung
</p>
<p>
All night upon his branches.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Yet let none
</p>
<p>
Of woman born, presume to build his hopes
</p>
<p>
On the worn cliff of brief prosperity,
</p>
<p>
Or from the present promise, predicate
</p>
<p>
The future joy. The exulting bird that sings
</p>
<p>
Mid the green curtains of its leafy nest
</p>
<p>
His tuneful trust untroubled there to live,
</p>
<p>
And there to die, may meet the archer's shaft
</p>
<p>
When next it spreads the wing.
</p>
<p class="i16">
The tempest folds
</p>
<p>
O'er the smooth forehead of the summer noon
</p>
<p>
Its undiscover'd purpose, to emerge
</p>
<p>
Resistless from its armory, and whelm
</p>
<p>
In floods of ruin, ere the day decline.

<p>
Explored the cause for which such woes were sent,

Forgetful that this mystery of life

And sighs like tides burst forth till I forget

To eat my bread. That which I greatly feared

Hath come upon me. Not in heedless pride

When trial came upon them, if their knees

<p>
Bow'd down, thou saidst, &#34;be strong,&#34; and they obey'd.

But now it toucheth thee and thou dost shrink,

And murmuring, faint. The monitor forgets

The precepts he hath taught. Is this thy faith,

<p>
Thy confidence, the uprightness of thy way?

Whoever perish'd being innocent?

<p>
And when were those who walk'd in righteous ways

<p>
Cut off? How oft I've seen that those who sow

Under a veil of darkness, reap the same.

Cheering thy home, and when thy course was done

About to be extinguished am I held

Weak reasoners that ye are, ye have essay'd

Ceaseless they wander and He heedeth not.

Those whom the world have worship'd seem as fools.

Silence is for you

Untimely strew the ground, shall be his trust

Vain, bitter words, and shake my head in scorn.

And solace shed upon your stricken hearts

With balm-drops of sweet speech.

<p class="i16">
Yet, as for me,

I speak and none regard, or drooping sit

In mournful silence, and none heed my woe.

And slander me in secret, though my cause

Furrow'd with wrinkles.

Mid snares and traps, and his own counsel fail

<p>
To guide him safely. By the heel, the gin

<p>
To rifle and destroy his treasure hoard.

Secret misgivings feed upon his strength,

And terrors waste his courage. He shall find

In his own tabernacle no repose,

No nutriment, and the unsparing ax

Cut off his branches. From a loathing world

He shall be chased away, and leave behind

<p>
No son or nephew to bear up his name

Among the people. No kind memories

Yet the same Hand that garnisheth the skies
</p>
<p>
Disdaineth not to fashion and sustain
</p>
<p>
The crooked serpent. But how small a part
</p>
<p>
Of all its works are understood by us
</p>
<p>
Dim dwellers in this lowly vestibule,
</p>
<p>
And by the thunders of mysterious power
</p>
<p>
Still held in awe.
</p>
<p class="i16">
As the Eternal lives
</p>
<p>
Who hath bow'd down my soul, as long as breath
</p>
<p>
Inspires this mortal frame, these lips shall ne'er
</p>
<p>
Utter deceit, nor cast away the wealth
</p>
<p>
Of a good conscience. While I live I'll hold
</p>
<p>
Fast mine integrity,&#8212;nor justify
</p>
<p>
The slanderous charges of a secret guilt
</p>
<p>
Ye bring against me.
</p>
<p class="i16">
For what is the gain
</p>
<p>
Of the base hypocrite when God shall take
</p>
<p>
Away his perjured soul? Yourselves have seen
</p>
<p>
How often in this life the wicked taste
</p>
<p>
Of retribution. The oppressor bears
</p>
<p>
Sway for a while,&#8212;but look!&#8212;the downfall comes.
</p>
<p>
His offspring shall not flourish, nor his grave
</p>
<p>
Be wet with widow's tears.

<p class="i16">
The unjust rich man
</p>
<p>
Heapeth up silver for a stranger's hand,

<p>
He hoardeth raiment with a miser's greed
</p>
<p>
To robe he knows not who, though he himself
</p>
<p>
Had grudg'd to wear it. Boastfully he builds
</p>
<p>
A costly mansion to preserve his name
</p>
<p>
Among the people. But like the slight booth,
</p>
<p>
Brief lodge of summer, shall it pass away.
</p>
<p>
Terrors without a cause, disable him
</p>
<p>
And drown his courage. Like a driven leaf
</p>
<p>
Before the whirlwind, shall he hasten down
</p>
<p>
To a dishonor'd tomb. Men shall rejoice,
</p>
<p>
And clap their hands, and hiss him from his place
</p>
<p>
When he departs.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Surely, there is a vein
</p>
<p>
For silver, and a secret bed for gold
</p>
<p>
Which man discovers. Where the iron sleeps
</p>
<p>
In darkest chambers of the mine he knows,
</p>
<p>
And how the brass is molten. But a Mind
</p>
<p>
Deeper than his, close-hidden things explores,
</p>
<p>
Searching out all perfection.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Earth unveils
</p>
<p>
The mystic treasures of her matron breast,
</p>
<p>
Bread for her children, gems like living flame,

<p>
Sapphires, whose azure emulates the skies,
</p>
<p>
And dust of gold. Yet there's a curtain'd path
</p>
<p>
Which the unfettered denizens of air
</p>
<p>
Have not descried, nor even the piercing eye
</p>
<p>
Of the black vulture seen. The lion's whelps
</p>
<p>
In their wide roaming, nor their fiercer sire
</p>
<p>
Have never trod it.
</p>
<p class="i16">
There's a Hand that bares
</p>
<p>
The roots of mountains at its will, and cuts
</p>
<p>
Through rifted rocks a channel, where the streams
</p>
<p>
And rivers freely flow&#8212;an Eye that scans
</p>
<p>
Each precious thing.
</p>
<p class="i16">
But where doth Wisdom dwell?
</p>
<p>
And in what curtain'd chamber was the birth
</p>
<p>
Of Understanding?
</p>
<p class="i16">
The great Sea uplifts
</p>
<p>
Its hand in adjuration, and declares
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>'Tis not with me</i>,&#34; and its unfathom'd deep
</p>
<p>
In subterranean thunders, echoing cry
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>No, not with me.</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Offer ye not for them
</p>
<p>
Silver, or Ophir's gold, nor think to exchange

Onyx, or sapphire, or the coral branch

Or crystal gem where hides imprison'd light,

Nor make ye mention of the precious pearl

Or Ethiopian topaz, for their price

Transcendeth rubies, or the dazzling ray

<p>
Of concentrated jewels.

In what place
</p>
<p>
Are found these wondrous treasures? Who will show

<p>
Their habitation? which alike defies

<p>
The ken of those who soar, or those who delve

<p>
In cells profound.

Death and destruction say,

<p>
From their hoarse caverns, &#34;We have heard their fame

Lo! He who weighs the winds

Measures the floods, controls the surging sea

He, unto whom all mysteries are plain

Saith unto man the questioner,&#8212;

</p>
<p class="i16">
Anguish wrings my soul
</p>
<p>
As in my hours of musing I restore
</p>
<p>
The picture of my lost prosperity,
</p>
<p>
When round my side my loving children drew
</p>
<p>
And from my happy home my steps were hail'd
</p>
<p>
Where'er I went. The fatherless and poor,
</p>
<p>
And he who had no helper, welcomed me
</p>
<p>
As one to right their wrongs, and pluck the spoil
</p>
<p>
From the oppressor's teeth. Pale widows raised
</p>
<p>
The glistening eye of gratitude, and they
</p>
<p>
Whose sight was quench'd, at my remembered tones
</p>
<p>
Pour'd blessings on me. Overflowing wealth
</p>
<p>
Brought me no titles that I held so dear
</p>
<p>
As father of the poor, and comforter
</p>
<p>
Of all who mourn.
</p>
<p class="i16">
When in the gate I sate
</p>
<p>
The nobles did me honor, and the wise
</p>
<p>
Sought counsel of me. To my words the young
</p>
<p>
Gave earnest heed, the white-hair'd men stood up,
</p>
<p>
And princes waited for my speech, as wait
</p>
<p>
The fields in summer for the latter rain.
</p>
<p>
But now, the children of base men spring up
</p>
<p>
And push away my feet, and make my name
</p>
<p>
A bye-word and a mockery, which was erst
</p>
<p>
Set to the harp in song.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Because my wealth
</p>
<p>
God hath resumed, they who ne'er dared to claim
</p>
<p>
Equality with even the lowest ones
</p>
<p>
Who watch'd my flock, they whom my menials scorned,
</p>
<p>
Dwellers in hovels, feeding like the brutes
</p>
<p>
On roots and bushes of the wilderness,
</p>
<p>
Despise me, and in mean derision cast
</p>
<p>
Marks of abhorrence at the fallen chief
</p>
<p>
Whom erst they fear'd.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Unpitied I endure
</p>
<p>
Sickness and pain that ope the narrow house

<p>
Where all the living go. My soul dissolves
</p>
<p>
And flows away as water&#8212;like the owl
</p>
<p>
In lone, forgotten cavern I complain,
</p>
<p>
For all my instruments of music yield
</p>
<p>
But mournful sounds, and from my organ comes
</p>
<p>
A sob of weeping.
</p>
<p class="i16">
I appeal to Him
</p>
<p>
Who sees my ways, and all my steps doth count,
</p>
<p>
If I have walk'd with vanity or worn
</p>
<p>
The veil of falsehood, or despised to obey
</p>
<p>
The law of duty; if I basely prowl'd
</p>
<p>
With evil purpose round my neighbor's door,
</p>
<p>
Or scorn'd my humblest menial's cause to right
</p>
<p>
When he contended with me, and complain'd,
</p>
<p>
Framed as he was of the same clay with me
</p>
<p>
By the same Hand Divine; or shunn'd to share
</p>
<p>
Even my last morsel with the hungry poor,
</p>
<p>
Or shield the uncovered suppliant with the fleece

<p>
Of my own cherish'd flock.

If ere I made

Fine gold my confidence, or lifted up

My heart in pride, because my wealth was great,

<p>
Or when I saw the glorious King of Day
</p>
<p>
Gladdening all nations, and the queenly Moon
</p>
<p>
Walking in brightness, was enticed to pay
</p>
<p>
A secret homage,&#8212;'twere idolatry
</p>
<p>
Unpardonably great.

If I rejoiced

<p>
In the affliction of mine enemy

Or for his hatred breathed a vengeful vow

</p>
<p>
The inhospitable door against the foot
</p>
<p>
Of stranger, or of traveller,&#8212;or withheld
</p>
<p>
Full nutriment from any who abode
</p>
<p>
Within my tabernacle,&#8212;or refused
</p>
<p>
Due justice even to my own furrow'd field,

And rootless weeds o'ertop the beardless grain.&#34;

<p>
Then ceased the Man of Uz, like one o'erspent,

<p>
Feeling the fallacy of argument

<p>
With auditors like these, his thoughts withdrew

<p>
Into the shroud of silence, and he spake
</p>
<p>
No more unto them, standing fix'd and mute,
</p>
<p>
Like statued marble.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Then, as none replied,
</p>
<p>
A youthful stranger rose, and while he stretch'd

<p>
His hand in act to speak, and heavenward raised
</p>
<p>
His clear, unshrinking brow, he worthy seem'd
</p>
<p>
To hold the balance of that high debate.
</p>
<p>
Still, an indignant warmth, with energy

<p>
Of fervid eloquence his lips inspired.

Wisdom to man, and so gave earnest heed

<p>
To every argument. And lo! not one
</p>
<p>
Of all your speeches have convicted Job,
</p>
<p>
Or proved your theory that woes like his
</p>
<p>
Denote a secret guilt.
</p>
<p class="i16">
I listened still
</p>
<p>
With that respect which youth doth owe to age,

And till ye ceased to speak, refrain'd to show
</p>

Mine own opinion. But there is a breath
</p>
<p>
From the Almighty, that gives life to thought,

<p>
And in my soul imprison'd utterance burns
</p>
<p>
Like torturing flame. So, will I give it vent

<p>
Though I am young in years, and ye are old,
</p>
<p>
And should be wise. I will not shun to uphold
</p>
<p>
The righteous cause, nor will I gloze the wrong

Hearken, O Job, I pray thee, to my words

<p>
More perfect innocence than appertains

To erring man, and eager to refute

False accusation hast contemn'd the course

Of the All-Merciful.

Why shouldst thou strive

Such hints and precepts as the docile heart

<p>
May comprehend. Sometimes in vision'd sleep,
</p>
<p>
His Spirit hovereth o'er the plastic mind
</p>
<p>
Sealing instruction. Or a different voice
</p>
<p>
Its sterner teaching tries. His vigor droops,
</p>
<p>
Strong pain amid the multitude of bones
</p>
<p>
Doth revel, till his soul abhorreth meat.
</p>
<p>
His fair flesh wastes, and downward to the pit

He hourly hastens. Holy Sympathy

Kindly interpreting the Will Divine,

Fresh as a child's, the wither'd flesh returns,

The creatures He hath made, to crush the seeds

Befitting them, and pleasing in His sight.

Open not thy mouth

Straighten her breadth of waters. Dropping rains

Dizzied with flashing fires.

</p>
<p>
The rattling quiver, and the glittering spear.
</p>
<p>
Prancing and proud, he swalloweth the ground
</p>
<p>
With rage, and passionate desire to rush
</p>
<p>
Into the battle. At the trumpet's sound,
</p>
<p>
And shouting of the captains, he exults,
</p>
<p>
Drawing the stormy terror with delight
</p>
<p>
Into his fearless spirit.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Doth the Hawk

In her migrations counsel ask of Thee?
</p>
<p>
Mounts the swift Eagle up at thy command?
</p>
<p>
Making her nest among the star-girt cliffs,
</p>
<p>
And thence undazzled by the vertic sun
</p>
<p>
Scanning the molehills of the earth, or motes
</p>

Thy might, and that thine own right hand hath power

And from the plaited armor of his scales

The glittering sword recoils. Where he reclines,

<p>
Who is so daring as to rouse him up,

With his cold, stony heart, and breath of flame?

Thick set with teeth, draw near?

THE RURAL LIFE IN NEW-ENGLAND.

INTRODUCTION.
</h3>
<p>
It may be thought that the following poem, especially its opening Canto is too minute and circumstantial in its descriptions. Yet the habitudes of a past and peculiar generation, fast fading from remembrance, are worthy of being preserved, though little accordant with romance, perhaps with poetry. So rapid has been our progress as a people, that dimness gathers over the lineaments of even our immediate ancestry. Yet traits at one period despised, or counted obsolete, may at another be diligently sought after and re-juvenated.
</p>
<p>
It has been observed that nations reaching their zenith, regard with more complacency their rising morn, than the approaching west. France, notwithstanding the precision given to her language by Richilieu, and the Academy, turns back affectionately to her Troubadours and Trouvires, to the long-drawn, scarce-readable &#34;Romance of the Rose,&#34; and the itinerant Chronicles of Froissart. England is not indifferent to Anglo-Saxon traditions, or the customs of her Norman dynasty.
</p>
<p>
A time may arrive when our posterity will not scorn to be reminded of the primitive usages of their rural fathers. To that time, and to unborn readers, this simple poem is dedicated.

<h3>
THE RURAL LIFE IN NEW-ENGLAND.
</h3>
<p class="chapter">
<a name="59">
CANTO FIRST.
</a>
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Peaceful is the rural life, made strong by healthful industry,
</p>
<p>
Firm in love of the birth-land, and the laws that govern it,
</p>
<p>
Calm through moderated desires and a primitive simplicity,
</p>
<p>
Walking filially with Nature as the Patriarchs walked with God.
</p>
<p>
Such have I beheld it in my native vales, green and elm-shaded.
</p>
<p>
Such hath it been depicted in their legends who went before me;
</p>
<p>
What therefore, I have seen and heard, declare I unto you
</p>
<p>
In measures artless and untuneful.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Fearless of hardship,
</p>
<p>
In costume, as in manners, unadorn'd and homely
</p>
<p>
Were our ancestral farmers, the seed-planters of a strong nation.
</p>
<p>
Congenial were their wives, not ashamed of the household charge,
</p>
<p>
Yoke-fellows that were help-meets, vigorous and of a good courage;
</p>
<p>
Revolting not at life's plain intent, but its duties discharging
</p>
<p>
Patiently, lovingly, and with true faith looking upward.
</p>
<p>
Thence came the rudiments of an inflexible people
</p>
<p>
Whose praise is in themselves.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Hail to the ancient farmer!
</p>
<p>
Broad-shouldered as Ajax&#8212;deep-chested through commerce with free air,
</p>
<p>
Not enervated by luxury, nor care-worn with gold-counting,
</p>
<p>
Content with his lot, by pride and envy unvisited.
</p>
<p>
Muscular was his arm, laying low the kings of the forest,
</p>
<p>
Uncouth might be his coat, and his heavy shoes, Vestris flouted,
</p>
<p>
At the grasp of his huge hand, the dainty belle might have shuddered.
</p>
<p>
Yet blessings on his bronzed face, and his warm, honest heart,
</p>
<p>
Whose well-rooted virtues were the strength and stay of republics.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="short">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
True independence was his, earth and sky being his bankers,
</p>
<p>
Bills drawn on them, endorsed by toil were never protested.
</p>
<p>
Bathed in vernal dews was his glistening plough-share,
</p>
<p>
Birds, newly-returned, the merry nest-builders, bade him good morrow,
</p>
<p>
Keenly wrought his scythe in summer, where fell the odorous clover,
</p>
<p>
Clear was his song at autumn-husking, amid piles of golden corn.
</p>
<p>
Winter saw him battling the drifted snows, with his oxen,
</p>
<p>
Bearing to the neighboring town, fuel that gladden'd the hearth-stone.
</p>
<p>
Deep in undisturbed beds then slept the dark-featured anthracite,
</p>
<p>
Steam not having armed itself to exterminate the groves,
</p>
<p>
Lavishly offering them as a holocaust to winged horses of iron,
</p>
<p>
Like Moloch, cruel god, dooming the beautiful to the flame.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="short">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Independent was the farmer, the food of his household being sure;
</p>
<p>
With the fields of waving grain; with the towering tassell'd maize;
</p>
<p>
With the herds, moving homeward, bearing their creamy nectar;
</p>
<p>
He saw, and gather'd it, giving thanks to the bountiful Father.
</p>
<p>
Among the lambs sporting in green pastures, among the feathery people,
</p>
<p>
Among the fruit-laden branches, he beheld it also;
</p>
<p>
Under the earth, on the earth, in the air, ripen'd his threefold crop.
</p>
<p>
Swelling in the cluster'd vine, and the roots of the teeming garden,
</p>
<p>
The Garden&#8212;precious spot! which God deign'd to bless at the beginning,
</p>
<p>
Placing therein Man, made after his own glorious image,
</p>
<p>
To dress it and to keep it.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Hail, to the ancient farmer,
</p>
<p>
Naught to him the fall of stocks that turns pale the speculator,
</p>
<p>
Naught to him the changes of trade, wrinkling the brow of the merchant,
</p>
<p>
Naught to him, the light weight, or exorbitant price of the baker;
</p>
<p>
Sure was his bread, howsoe'er the markets might fluctuate,
</p>
<p>
Sweet loaves of a rich brown, plentifully graced his table,
</p>
<p>
Made by the neat hand of wife or daughter, happy in healthful toil.
</p>
<p>
Skilfully wrought the same hands, amid the treasures of the dairy,
</p>
<p>
Rich cheeses, and masses of golden butter, and bowls of fragrant milk
</p>
<p>
Not doled out warily, as by city dames, but to all, free and flowing;
</p>
<p>
Woman's right it was, to crown the board with gifts of her own preparing;
</p>
<p>
Rights not disputed, not clamored for in public assemblies,
</p>
<p>
But conceded by approving Love, whose manliness threw around her
</p>
<p>
A cherishing protection, such as God willed in Paradise.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="short">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Dense was the head of the Maple, and in summer of a lustrous green,
</p>
<p>
Yet earliest in autumn, among all trees of the forest,
</p>
<p>
To robe itself in scarlet, like a cardinal going to conclave.
</p>
<p>
Subjected was it in spring, to a singular phlebetomy;
</p>
<p>
Tubes inserted through its bark, drew away the heart's sweet blood,
</p>
<p>
Pore after pore emptying itself, till the great arteries were exhausted.
</p>
<p>
Fires then blazed amid the thickets, like the moveable camp of the gipsies,
</p>
<p>
And in boiling kettles, fiercely eddying, struggled the caloric,
</p>
<p>
With gases, and the saccharine spirit, until the granulated sugar,
</p>
<p>
Showed a calm, brown face, welcome to the stores of the housewife;
</p>
<p>
Moulded also into small cakes, it formed the favorite confection
</p>
<p>
Of maiden and swain, during the long evenings of courtship.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr class="short">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Gamboling among wild flowers, gadded the honey-bee,
</p>
<p>
Bending down their innocent heads, with a buzzing lore of flattery,
</p>
<p>
Beguiling them of their essences, which with tireless alacrity,
</p>
<p>
Straightway deposited he in his cone-roof'd banking-house,
</p>
<p>
Subtle financier&#8212;thinking to take both dividend and capital.
</p>
<p>
But failing in his usury, for duly cometh the farmer,
</p>
<p>
Despoiling him of his hoard, yea! haply of his life also.
</p>
<p>
Stern was the policy of the olden times, to that diligent insect,
</p>
<p>
Not skill'd like our own, to confiscate a portion of his earnings,
</p>
<p>
Leaving life and limb unscathed for future enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Welcome were the gifts of that winged chemist to a primitive people.
</p>
<p>
Carefully cloistered in choice vases, was the pure, virgin honey,
</p>
<p>
Sacred to honor'd guests, or a balm to the sore-throated invalid.
</p>
<p>
Dealt out charily, was the fair comb to the gratified little ones,
</p>
<p>
Or, to fermentation yielded, producing the spirited metheglin.
</p>
<p>
Not scorn'd by the bee-masters, were even those darken'd hexagons
</p>
<p>
Where slumber'd the dead like the coral-builders in reefy cell.
</p>
<p>
Even these to a practical use devoted the clear-sighted matron,
</p>
<p>
Calling forth from cavernous sepulchres cheerful light for the living.
</p>
<p>
Cleansed and judiciously mingled with an oleagenous element,
</p>
<p>
Thus drew she from the mould, waxen candles, whose gold-tinted beauty
</p>
<p>
Crown'd proudly the mantel-piece, reserved for bettermost occasions.
</p>
<p>
Unheard of, then, was the gas, with briliant jet and gorgeous chandelier,
</p>
<p>
Nor hunted they from zone to zone, with barbed harpoon the mighty whale,
</p>
<p>
Making the indignant monarch of ocean, their flambeau and link-boy:
</p>
<p>
For each household held within itself, its own fountain of light.
</p>
<p>
Faithful was the rural housewife, taking charge of all intrusted things,
</p>
<p>
Prolonging the existence of whatever needed repair,
</p>
<p>
Requiring children to respect the property of their parents,
</p>
<p>
Not to waste or destroy, but be grateful for food and clothing;
</p>
<p>
Teaching them industry, and the serious value of fleeting time,
</p>
<p>
Strict account of which must be rendered to the Master and Giver of Life.
</p>
<p>
Prudence was then held in esteem and a laudable economy
</p>
<p>
Not jeered at by miserly names, but held becoming in all,
</p>
<p>
For the poor, that they might avoid debt; and the rich that they might be justly generous.
</p>

<p>
Ho! for the flax-field, with its flower of blue and leaf freshly green,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Ho! for the snowy fleece, which the quiet flock yield to their master,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Woman's hand shall transmute both, into armor for those she loves,
</p>
<p>
Wrapping her household in comfort, and her own heart in calm content.
</p>
<p>
Hark! at her flaxen distaff cheerily singeth the matron,
</p>
<p>
Hymns, that perchance, were mingled with her own cradle melodies.
</p>
<p>
Back and forth, at the Great Wheel, treadeth the buxom damsel,
</p>
<p>
Best form of calisthenics, exercising well every muscle
</p>
<p>
Regularly and to good purpose, filling the blue veins with richer blood.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly on the spindle, gather threads from the pendent roll,
</p>
<p>
Not by machinery anatomized, till stamina and staple fly away,
</p>
<p>
But with hand-cards concocted, and symmetrically formed,
</p>
<p>
Of wool, white or grey, or the refuse flax smoothed to a silky lustre,
</p>
<p>
It greeteth the fingers of the spinner.
</p>
<p class="i18">
In this Hygeian concert
</p>
<p>
Leader of the Orchestra, was the Great Wheel's tireless tenor,
</p>
<p>
Drowning the counter of the snapping reel, and the quill-wheels fitful symphony,
</p>
<p>
Whose whirring strings, yielded to children's hands, prepare spools for the shuttle.
</p>
<p>
At intervals, like a muffled drum, sounded the stroke of the loam,
</p>
<p>
Cumbrous, and filling a large space, with its quantity of timber,
</p>
<p>
Obedient only to a vigorous arm, which in ruling it grew more vigorous.
</p>
<p>
From its massy beam were unrolled, fabrics varied and substantial,
</p>
<p>
Linen for couch and table, and the lighter garniture of summer,
</p>
<p>
Frocks of a flaxen color for the laborer, or striped with blue for the younglings;
</p>
<p>
Stout garments in which man bides the buffet of wintry elements.
</p>
<p>
From the rind of the stately butternut, drew they a brown complexion,
</p>
<p>
Or the cerulean borrowed from the tint of the southern indigo.
</p>
<p>
Thus rustic Industry girded itself, amid household music,
</p>
<p>
As History of old, set her fabulous legends to the harp.
</p>
<p>
Ears trained to the operas of Italy, would find discordance to be mocked at,
</p>
<p>
But the patriot heard the ring of gold in the coffers of his country,
</p>
<p>
Not sent forth to bankruptcy, for the flowery silks of France;
</p>
<p>
While the listening christian caught the strong harmonies of a peaceful Land,
</p>
<p>
Giving praise to Jehovah.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Lo! at the winter evening
</p>
<p>
In these uncarpeted dwellings, what a world of comfort!
</p>
<p>
Large hickory logs send a dancing flame up the ample chimney,
</p>
<p>
Tinging with ruddy gleam, every face around the broad hearth-stone.
</p>
<p>
King and patriarch, in the midst, sitteth the true-hearted farmer.
</p>
<p>
At his side, the wife with her needle, still quietly regardeth the children.
</p>
<p>
Sheltered in her corner-nook, in the arm-chair, the post of honor,
</p>
<p>
Calm with the beauty of age, is the venerable grandmother.
</p>
<p>
Clustering around her, watching the stocking that she knits, are the little ones,
</p>
<p>
Loving the stories that she tells of the days when she was a maiden,
</p>
<p>
Stories ever mix'd with lessons of a reverent piety.
</p>
<p>
Manna do they thus gather to feed on, when their hair is hoary.
</p>
<p>
Stretch'd before the fire, is the weary, rough-coated house-dog,
</p>
<p>
Winking his eyes, full of sleep, at the baby, seated on his shoulder,
</p>
<p>
Proudly watching his master's darling, and the pet of the family,
</p>
<p>
As hither and thither on its small feet it toddles unsteadily.

On the straight-back'd oaken settle, congregate the older children.
</p>
<p>
Work have they, or books, and sometimes the weekly newspaper,
</p>
<p>
Grey, on coarse, crumpled paper, and borrowed from house to house,
</p>
<p>
Small-sized, yet precious, and read through from beginning to end,
</p>
<p>
Bright, young heads circling close, peering together over its columns.
</p>
<p>
Now and then, furtive glances reconnoitre the ingle-side,
</p>
<p>
Where before a bed of coals, rows of red apples are roasting,
</p>
<p>
Spitting out their life-juices spitefully, in unwilling martyrdom.
</p>
<p>
Finished, and drawn back, the happy group wait a brief interval,
</p>
<p>
Thinking some neighbor might chance to come in and bid them good even,

Heightening their simple refection, for whose sake would be joyously added
</p>
<p>
The mug of sparkling cider passed temperately from lip to lip,
</p>
<p>
Sufficient and accepted offering of ancient, true-hearted hospitality.

Thus in colonial times dwelt they together as brethren,

Taking part in each others' concerns with an undissembled sympathy.

But when the tall old clock told out boldly three times three,
</p>
<p>
Thrice the number of the graces, thrice the number of the fates,
</p>
<p>
The full number of the Muses, the hour dedicated to Morpheus,
</p>
<p>
At that curfew departed the guest, and all work being suspended,
</p>
<p>
Laid aside was the grandmother's knitting-bag, for in its cradle
</p>
<p>
Rock'd now and then by her foot, already slumbered the baby.
</p>
<p>
Then, ere the fading brands were covered with protecting ashes,
</p>
<p>
Rose the prayer of the Sire, amid his treasured and trusted ones,
</p>
<p>
Rose his thanks for past blessings, his petitions for the future,
</p>
<p>
His committal of all care to Him who careth for his creatures,

<p>
Overlooking nothing that His bountiful Hand hath created.

Orderly were the households of the farmer, not given to idle merriment,
</p>
<p>
Honoring the presence of parents, as of tutelary spirits.
</p>
<p>
To be obedient and useful were the first lessons of the young children,
</p>
<p>
Well learned and bringing happiness, that ruled on sure foundations,
</p>
<p>
Respect for authority, being the initial of God's holy fear.
</p>
<p>
Modern times might denounce such a system as tyrannical,
</p>
<p>
Asking the blandishments of indulgence, and a broader liberty;
</p>
<p>
Leaving in perplexing doubt, the mind of the infant stranger
</p>
<p>
Whether to rule or to be ruled he came hither on his untried journey,
</p>
<p>
Rearing him in headstrong ignorance, revolting at discipline,

Heady, high-minded, and prone to speak evil of dignities.

Welcome was Winter, to the agriculturist of olden times,
</p>
<p>
Then, while fruitful Earth, with whom he was in league, held her sabbath,
</p>
<p>
Knowledge entered into his soul. At the lengthened evening,
</p>
<p>
Read he in an audible voice to his listening family
</p>
<p>
Grave books of History, or elaborate Theology,
</p>
<p>
Taxing thought and memory, but not setting fancy on tiptoe
</p>
<p>
Teaching reverence for wise men, and for God, the Giver of Wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Not then had the era arrived, when of making books there is no end.
</p>
<p>
Painfully the laboring press, brought forth like the kingly whale
</p>
<p>
One cub at a time, guiding it carefully over the billows,
</p>
<p>
Watching with pride and pleasure, its own wonderful offspring.
</p>
<p>
A large, fair volume, was in those days, as molten gold,
</p>
<p>
Touched only with clean hands, and by testators willed to their heirs.

Winter also, brought the school for the boys,&#8212;released from farm-labor.
</p>
<p>
Early was the substantial breakfast, in those short, frosty mornings,
</p>
<p>
That equipped in season, might be the caravan for its enterprise,
</p>
<p>
Punctuality in those simple times being enrolled among the virtues.
</p>
<p>
There they go! a rosy group, bearing in small baskets their dinner;
</p>
<p>
Plunging thro' all snow-drifts, the boys,&#8212;on all ices sliding the girls,
</p>
<p>
Yet leaving not the straight path, lest tardy should be their arrival.
</p>
<p>
Lone on the bleak hill-side, stood the unpainted village school-house,
</p>
<p>
Winds taking aim at it like a target, smoke belching from its chimney,
</p>
<p>
Bare to the fiery suns of summer, like the treeless Nantucket.
</p>
<p>
Desks were ranged under the windows where on high benches without backs
</p>
<p>
Sate the little ones, their feet vainly reaching toward the distant floor,
</p>
<p>
Commanded everlastingly to keep still and to be still,
</p>
<p>
As if immobility were the climax of all excellence;
</p>
<p>
Hard lesson for quick nerves, and eyes searching for something new.
</p>
<p>
Nature endowed them with curiosity, but man wiser than she
</p>
<p>
Calling himself a teacher, would fain stiffen them into statues.
</p>
<p>
No bright visions of the school-palaces of future days
</p>
<p>
With seats of ease, and carpets, and pianos, and pictured walls,
</p>
<p>
And green lawns, pleasantly shaded, stretching wide for play,
</p>
<p>
And knowledge fondling her pets, and unveiling her royal road,
</p>
<p>
Gleam'd before them as Eden, kindling smiles on their thoughtful faces.

Favor'd were the elder scholars with more congenial tasks:
</p>
<p>
Loudly read they in their classes, glorying in the noise they made,
</p>
<p>
Busily over the slates moved the hard pencils, with a grating sound,
</p>
<p>
Diligently on coarse paper wrote they, with quill pens, bushy topp'd,
</p>
<p>
Blessed in having lived, ere the metallic stylus was invented.
</p>
<p>
Rang'd early around the fire, have been their frozen inkstands,
</p>
<p>
Where in rotation sits each scholar briefly, by the master's leave,
</p>
<p>
Roasting on one side, and on the other a petrefaction,
</p>
<p>
Keen blasts through the crevices delighting to whistle and mock them.
</p>
<p>
Patient were the children, not given to murmuring or complaining,
</p>
<p>
Learning through privation, lessons of value for a future life,
</p>
<p>
Subjection, application, and love of knowledge for itself alone.
</p>
<p>
On a high chair, sate the solemn Master, watchful of all things,
</p>
<p>
Absolute was his sway and in this authority he gloried,
</p>
<p>
Conforming it much to the Spartan rule, and the code of Solomon,
</p>
<p>
Showing no mercy to idleness, or wrong uses of the slippery tongue:
</p>
<p>
Yet to diligent students kind, and of their proficiency boastful,
</p>
<p>
Exhibiting their copy-books, to committee-man and visitant,
</p>
<p>
Or calling out the declaimers, in some stentorian dialogue.
</p>
<p>
Few were the studies then pursued, but thoroughness required in all,
</p>
<p>
Surface-work not being in vogue, nor rootless blossoms regarded.
</p>
<p>
Especially well-taught was the orthography of our copious language,
</p>
<p>
False spelling being as a sin to be punished by the judges.
</p>
<p>
In this difficult attainment the master sometimes accorded
</p>
<p>
A form of friendly conflict sought with ardor as a premium,
</p>
<p>
Stirring the belligerent element, ever strong in boyish natures.
</p>
<p>
Forth came at close of the school-day, two of reproachless conduct,
</p>
<p>
Naming first the best spellers, they proceeded to choose alternately,
</p>
<p>
Till all, old and young, ranging under opposite banners,
</p>
<p>
Drawn up as in battle array, each other stoutly confronted.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly given out by the leaders to their marshall'd forces,
</p>
<p>
Word by word, with its definition, was the allotted lesson,
</p>
<p>
Vociferously answered from each side like discharges of artillery;
</p>
<p>
Fatal was the slightest mistake, fatal even pause or hesitation,
</p>
<p>
Doubt was for the vanquished, to deliberate was to be lost.
</p>
<p>
Drooping with disgrace down sate each discomfited pupil,
</p>
<p>
Bravely stood the perfect, the most unbroken line gaining the victory.
</p>
<p>
Not unboastful were the conquerers, cheered with shouts on their homeward way,
</p>
<p>
Crest-fallen were the defeated, yet eager for a future contest.
</p>
<p>
Strong elements thus enlisted, gave new vigor to mental toil,
</p>
<p>
As the swimmer puts forth more force till the rapids are overpast.
</p>
<p>
Dear to the persevering, were those schools of the olden time,
</p>
<p>
Respected were the teachers, who with majestic austerity,
</p>
<p>
Dispensed without favoritism, a Lacedamonian justice.
</p>
<p>
Learning was not then loved for luxury, like a lady for her gold,
</p>
<p>
But testing her worshippers by trial, knew who sought her for herself.

Not given to frequent feasting was the home-bred farmer of New England,
</p>
<p>
Parties, and the popular lectures swelled not his code of enjoyments.
</p>
<p>
One banquet, climax of his convivial delight, was the yearly thanksgiving,
</p>
<p>
Substituted by puritan settlers for the Christmas of the Mother-Clime,
</p>
<p>
Keeping in memory the feast of ingathering, of the Ancient Covenant People;
</p>
<p>
Drear November was its appointed season, when earth's bounty being garnered,
</p>
<p>
Man might rest from his labors, and praise the Lord of the Harvest.
</p>
<p>
Such was its original design, but the tendencies of Saxonism,
</p>
<p>
Turn'd it more to eating and drinking, than devotional remembrance.
</p>
<p>
Yet blessed was the time, summoning homeward every wanderer:
</p>
<p>
Back came the city apprentice, and from her service place the damsel,
</p>
<p>
Back came the married daughter to the father's quiet hearth-stone,
</p>
<p>
Wrapped warmly in her cloak is a babe, its eyes full of wonder,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Hand in hand, walked the little ones, bowing low before the grandparents,
</p>
<p>
Meekly craving their blessing, for so had they been piously taught.
</p>
<p>
Back to the birth-spot, to the shadow of their trees ancestral,
</p>
<p>
Came they like joyous streams, to their first untroubled fountain,
</p>
<p>
Knowing better how to prize it, from the rocks that had barred their course.
</p>
<p>
In primitive guise, journeyed homeward those dispersed ones.
</p>
<p>
Rare, in these days, was the carriage, or stage-coach for the traveller;
</p>
<p>
Roads, unmacadamized, making rude havoc of delicate springs.
</p>
<p>
Around the door, horses gather with the antique side-saddle and pillion,
</p>
<p>
Led thence to the full barn, while their riders find heartfelt welcome.

Then all whom culinary cares release, hasten to the House of Worship,

Religion being invoked to sanction the rejoicing of the fathers.

Plain was the village-church, a structure of darkened wood,
</p>
<p>
Having doors on three sides, and flanked by sheds for the horses,
</p>
<p>
Guiltless of blackening stove-pipe, or the smouldering fires of the furnace.
</p>
<p>
Assaulted oft were its windows, by the sonorous North-Western,
</p>
<p>
Making organ-pipes in the forest, for its shrill improvisations
</p>
<p>
Patient of cold, sate the people, each household in its own square pew,
</p>
<p>
Palisaded above the heads of the children, imprisoning their roving eyes.
</p>
<p>
Patiently sate the people, while from 'neath the great sounding-board,
</p>
<p>
The preacher unfolded his sermon, like the many-headed cauliflower.
</p>
<p>
Grave was the good pastor, not prone to pamper animal appetites,
</p>
<p>
But mainly intent to deal with that which is immortal.
</p>
<p>
Prolix might he have been deemed, save by the flock he guided,

<p>
Who duteously accounted him but a little lower than the angels.

At length, around the table,

Duly bless'd by the Master of the feast, they cheerily assemble.

<p>
Before him, as his perquisite, and prerogative to carve.
</p>
<p>
In a lordly dish smokes the huge, well-browned Turkey,
</p>
<p>
Chickens were there, to whose innocent lives Thanksgiving is ever a death-knell;
</p>
<p>
Luscious roasters from the pen, the large ham of a red complexion,
</p>
<p>
Garnish'd and intermingled with varied forms of vegetable wealth.
</p>
<p>
Ample pasties were attached, and demolished with dexterity,
</p>
<p>
Custards and tarts, and compounds of the golden-faced pumpkin,
</p>
<p>
Prime favorite, without whose aid, scarcely could New England have been thankful.
</p>
<p>
Apples, with plump, waxen cheeks, chestnuts, and the fruit of the hickory,
</p>
<p>
Bisected neatly, without fragment, furnished the simple dessert,
</p>
<p>
Finale to that festival where each guest might be safely merry.

<p>
Hence, by happy-hearted children, was it hailed as the pole-star,
</p>
<p>
Toward which Memory looked backward six months, and Hope forward for six to come,

Dating reverently from its era, as the Moslem from his Hegira.
</p>

Hymen also hailed it as his revenue, and crowning time;
</p>
<p>
Bachelors wearied with the restraints that courtship imposes,

<p>
Longed for it, as the Israelite for the jubilee of release,

Thus, as it was in the days before us,

<p>
Rural life in New-England, with its thrift, and simplicity,

<p>
Minutely have I depicted, not emulous of embellishment.

<p>
More of refinement might it boast when our beautiful birth-clime,

<p>
From the colonial chrysalis emerging, spread her wing among the nations.
</p>
<p>
Then rose an aristocracy, founded not on wealth alone

That winds may scatter like desert sands, or the floods wash away,

Mid its cultured acres rose gracefully a dwelling of the better class,

<p>
Large, but not lofty, its white walls softened by surrounding shades,
</p>
<p>
Fresh turf at its feet like velvet, green boughs bannering its head,
</p>
<p>
Bannering, and dropping music, till the last rustle of the falling leaves.
</p>
<p>
There, still in her comely prime, dwelt the lady of the mansion.
</p>
<p>
Moderate would her fortune be held in these days that count by millions,
</p>

Yet rich was she, because having no debts, what seemed to be hers, was so;
</p>
<p>
Rich, in having a surplus for the poor, which she gladly imparted;
</p>
<p>
Rich too, through Agriculture, pursued less from need than habit.
</p>
<p>
Habit mingled with satisfaction, and bringing health in its train.
</p>
<p>
Early widowhood had touched her brow with sadness such as time bringeth,
</p>
<p>
Yet in her clear eye was a fortitude, surmounting adversity.
</p>
<p>
Busy were her maidens, and happy, their right conduct kindly approved,
</p>
<p>
Busy also the swains thro' whose toil her fields yielded increase,

<p>
Respect had she for labor; knowing both what to require, and when it was well performed,
</p>
<p>
Readily rendering full wages, with smiles and words of counsel,
</p>
<p>
Accounting those who served her, friends, entitled to advice and sympathy.
</p>
<p>
Thus, looking well to the ways of her household, and from each expecting their duty,
</p>

Wisely divided she her time, and at intervals of leisure,

CANTO THIRD.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I'll change my measure, and so end my lay,
</p>
<p>
Too long already.
</p>
<p class="i16">
I can't manage well
</p>
<p>
The metre of that master of the lyre,
</p>
<p>
Who Hiawatha, and our forest tribes
</p>
<p>
Deftly described. Hexameters, I hate,
</p>
<p>
And henceforth do eschew their company,
</p>
<p>
For what is written irksomely, will be
</p>
<p>
Read in like manner.
</p>
<p class="i16">
What did I say last
</p>
<p>
In my late canto? Something, I believe
</p>
<p>
Of gratitude.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Now this same gratitude
</p>
<p>
Is a fine word to play on. Many a niche
</p>
<p>
It fills in letters, and in billet-doux,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Its adjective a graceful prefix makes
</p>
<p>
To a well-written signature. It gleams
</p>
<p>
A happy mirage in a sunny brain;
</p>
<p>
But as a principle, is oft, I fear,
</p>
<p>
Inoperative. Some satirist hath said
</p>
<p>
That
<i>
gratitude is only a keen sense</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Of future favors</i>.
</p>
<p class="i16">
As regards myself,
</p>
<p>
Tis my misfortune, and perhaps, my fault,
</p>
<p>
Yet I'm constrain'd to say, that where my gifts
</p>
<p>
And efforts have been greatest, the return
</p>
<p>
Has been in contrast. So that I have shrunk
</p>
<p>
To grant myself the pleasure of great love
</p>
<p>
Lest its reward might be indifference,
</p>
<p>
Or smooth deceit. Others no doubt have been
</p>
<p>
More fortunate. I trust 'tis often so:
</p>
<p>
But this is my experience, on the scale
</p>
<p>
Of three times twenty years, and somewhat more.

In that calm happiness which Virtue gives,
</p>
<p>
Blent with the daily zeal of doing good,
</p>
<p>
Mother and daughter dwelt.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Once, as they came
</p>
<p>
From their kind visit to a child of need,
</p>
<p>
Cheered by her blessings,&#8212;at their home they found
</p>
<p>
Miranda and her son. With rapid speech,
</p>
<p>
And strong emotion that resisted tears
</p>
<p>
Her tale she told. Forsaken were they both,
</p>
<p>
By faithless sire and husband. He had gone
</p>
<p>
To parts unknown, with an abandon'd one
</p>
<p>
He long had follow'd. Brokenly she spake
</p>
<p>
Of taunts and wrongs long suffer'd and conceal'd
</p>
<p>
With woman's pride. Then bitterly she pour'd
</p>
<p>
Her curses on his head.
</p>
<p class="i16">
With shuddering tears
</p>
<p>
They press'd her to their hearts.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Come back! Come back!
</p>
<p>
To your first home, and Heaven's compassions heal
</p>
<p>
Your wounded spirit.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Lovingly they cast
</p>
<p>
Their mantle o'er her, striving to uplift
</p>
<p>
Her thoughts to heavenly sources, and allure
</p>
<p>
To deeds of charity, that draw the sting
</p>
<p>
From selfishness of sorrow.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
But she shrank
</p>
<p>
From social intercourse, nor took her seat
</p>
<p>
Even in the House of God, lest prying eyes
</p>
<p>
Should gloat upon her downfall. Books, nor work
</p>
<p>
Enticed her, and the lov'd piano's tone
</p>
<p>
Waking sad echoes of the days that were,
</p>
<p>
She seem'd to shun. Her joy was in her child.
</p>
<p>
The chief delight and solace of her life
</p>
<p>
To adorn his dress, and trim his shining curls,
</p>
<p>
Dote on his beauty, and conceal his faults,
</p>
<p>
With weak indulgence.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Oh, Miranda, love!
</p>
<p>
Teach your fair boy, obedience. 'Tis the first
</p>
<p>
Lesson of life. To him, you fill the place
</p>
<p>
Of that Great Teacher who doth will us all
</p>
<p>
To learn submission.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
But Miranda will'd
</p>
<p>
In her own private mind, not to adopt
</p>
<p>
Such old-world theories, deeming the creed
</p>
<p>
Of the grey-headed Mother, obsolete.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;Her boy was fair; but in those manners fail'd
</p>
<p>
That render beauty pleasing. Great regard
</p>
<p>
Had he for self, and play, and dainty food,
</p>
<p>
Unlike those Jewish children, who refused
</p>
<p>
The fare luxurious of Chaldea's king,
</p>
<p>
And on their simple diet grow more fair
</p>
<p>
And healthful than their mates, and wiser too,
</p>
<p>
Than the wise men of Babylon.
</p>
<p class="i16">
I've seen
</p>
<p>
Ill-fortune follow those, whose early tastes
</p>
<p>
Were pampered and inured to luxury.
</p>
<p>
Their palates seem'd to overtop the brain,
</p>
<p>
And the rank Dives-pleasure, to subvert
</p>
<p>
Childhood's simplicity of sweet content.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;Precocious appetites, when overruled,
</p>
<p>
Or disappointed, lend imperious strength
</p>
<p>
To evil tempers, and a fierce disdain.
</p>
<p>
Methought, our Mother-Land, in this respect
</p>
<p>
Had wiser usages. Her little ones
</p>
<p>
At their own regular, plain table learn'd
</p>
<p>
No culinary criticism, nor claim'd
</p>
<p>
Admission to the richly furnish'd board
</p>
<p>
Nor deem'd the viands of their older friends
</p>
<p>
Pertain'd to them.
</p>
<p class="i16">
A pleasant sight it was
</p>
<p>
At close of day, their simple supper o'er,
</p>
<p>
To find them in the quiet nursery laid,
</p>
<p>
Like rose-buds folded in a fragrant sheath
</p>
<p>
To peaceful slumber. Hence their nerves attain'd
</p>
<p>
Firm texture, and the key-stone of the frame,
</p>
<p>
This wondrous frame, so often sinn'd against,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Unwarp'd and undispeptic, gave to life

A higher zest.

Year after year swept by,

<p>
And Conrad's symmetry of form and face

Grew more conspicuous. Yet he fail'd to win

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#8212;At school and college he defied restraint,

Threw a mysterious veil. But rumor spake

Of them, as those who would be sure to bring
</p>
<p>
Disgrace and infamy.

<p class="i16">
Strong thirst for gold

<p>
Sprang with the weeds of vice. His mother's purse
</p>
<p>
Was drain'd for him, and when at length she spake
</p>
<p>
In warm remonstrance, he with rudeness rush'd
</p>
<p>
Out of her presence, or withdrew himself
</p>
<p>
All night from her abode. Then she was fain
</p>
<p>
To appease his anger by some lavish gift
</p>
<p>
From scant resources, which she ill could spare,
</p>
<p>
Making the evil worse.
</p>
<p class="i16">
The growth of sin
</p>
<p>
Is rank and rapid when the youthful heart
</p>
<p>
Abjures the sway of duty. Weaving oft
</p>
<p>
The mesh of falsehood, may it not forget
</p>
<p>
What the truth is? The wavering, moral sense
</p>
<p>
Depraved and weaken'd, fails to grasp the clue
</p>
<p>
Of certainty, nor scruples to deny
</p>
<p>
Words utter'd, and deeds done, for conscience sleeps
</p>
<p>
Stifled, and callous. Fearful must it be,

When Truth offended and austere, confronts

</p>
<p>
Who with him in this work of horror join'd,
</p>
<p>
He answered nothing.
</p>
<p class="i16">
All unmov'd he stood
</p>
<p>
Upon his trial, the nefarious deed

<p>
Denying, and of his accomplices
</p>
<p>
Disclosing nought. But still there seem'd a chain
</p>
<p>
Of evidence to bind him in its coil,
</p>
<p>
And Justice had her course. The prison bolts

<p>
Closed heavily behind him, and his doom

<p>
For years, with felons was incorporate.

Of the wild anguish and despair that reign'd
</p>
<p>
In his ancestral home, no words can give

<p>
Description meet.
</p>
<p class="i16">
In the poor mother's mind
</p>
<p>
Reason forsook its throne. Her last hope gone,
</p>
<p>
Torn by a torrent from her death-like grasp,
</p>
<p>
Having no anchor on the eternal Rock,
</p>
<p>
She plunged beside it, into gulphs profound.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;She slept not, ate not, heeded no kind word,
</p>
<p>
Caress of fondness, or benignant prayer:
</p>
<p>
She only shriek'd,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;My boy! my beautiful!
</p>
<p>
They bind his hands!&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
And then with frantic cries
</p>
<p>
She struggled 'gainst imaginary foes,
</p>
<p>
Till strength was gone.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Through the long syncope
</p>
<p>
Her never-resting lips essay'd to form
</p>
<p>
The gasping sounds,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;My boy! my beautiful!
</p>
<p>
Hence! Caitiffs! hence! my boy! my beautiful!&#34;

Like lamp before the blast.

With sullen port

Though it hath come upon him, Conrad met
</p>
<p>
The sentence of the law. But its full force
</p>
<p>
He fail'd to estimate; the stern restraint
</p>
<p>
On liberty of movement, coarsest fare,
</p>
<p>
Stripes for the contumacious, and for all

<p>
Labor, and silence.

<p class="i16">
The inquiring glance

On the new-comer bent, from stolid eyes

And hating all mankind, he coldly shunn'd
</p>
<p>
Or haughtily return'd. Yet there were lights
</p>
<p>
Even in this dark abode, not often found
</p>
<p>
In penal regions, where the wrath of man

Is prompt to punish, and remembereth not

Bearing his supper, every prisoner went,

<p>
The night-lock firmly clench'd, beside some grate

<p>
While the large lamp thro' the long corridors
</p>
<p>
Threw flickering light, the Chaplain often stood
</p>
<p>
Conversing. Of the criminal's past life

He made inquiry, and receiv'd replies

<p>
Foreign from truth, or vague and taciturn:

Heeded but slightly, or ill understood.

The lily-handed, smiting at the forge,

Detested life, and meditated means

To accomplish suicide.
</p>
<p class="i16">
At dusk of eve,
</p>

While in his cell, on darkest themes he mused,

Before his grate, a veiled woman stood.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

A purer atmosphere seem'd breathing round

To expand his shrivell'd heart.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Fair gifts she brought,
</p>
<p>
Roses fresh-blown, and cates, and fragrant fruits

Most grateful to his fever'd lip.

&#34;Oh speak!

Speak to me!&#34;

Hope! hope! Its magic wand
</p>
<p>
With phosphorescence ting'd that Stygian pool

<p>
Of chill despair, in which his soul had sank
</p>
<p>
Lower and lower still. Now, at the forge
</p>
<p>
A blessed vision gleam'd. Its mystery woke
</p>
<p>
The romance of his nature. Every day
</p>
<p>
Moved lighter on, and when he laid it down,
</p>
<p>
It breathed &#34;<i>good night</i>!&#34; like a complacent child
</p>
<p>
Going to rest. One barrier less remain'd
</p>
<p>
Between him and the goal, and to each night
</p>
<p>
A tarrying, tedious guest, he bade farewell,
</p>
<p>
Like lover, counting toward his spousal-morn.

And then, he blamed the doubt.
</p>
<p>
His pulse beat quicker, as the old moon died.
</p>
<p>
And when the slender sickle of pale gold
</p>
<p>
Cut the blue concave, by his grated door
</p>
<p>
Stood the veil'd visitant. The breath of flowers
</p>
<p>
Foretold her coming. With their wealth she brought
</p>
<p>
Grapes in the cluster, and a clasped Book,
</p>
<p>
The holiest, and the best.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Show me thine eyes!&#34;
</p>
<p>
He pray'd. But still with undrawn veil, she gave
</p>
<p>
The promise of return, in whisper sweet,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Good night! good night!

<p class="i16">
Wilt read my Book? and say

So, by the lamp
</p>
<p>
When tardy Evening still'd the din of toil,
</p>
<p>
He read of Him who came to save the lost,
</p>
<p>
Who touch'd the blind, and they receiv'd their sight,
</p>
<p>
The dead young man, and raised him from his bier,
</p>
<p>
Reproved the raging Sea, and it was still:
</p>
<p>
Deeds that his boyhood heard unheedingly.
</p>
<p>
But here, in this strange solitude of pain
</p>
<p>
With different voice they spake. And as he read,
</p>
<p>
The fragrance of the mignionette he loved,
</p>
<p>
Press'd 'tween the pages, lured him onward still.

Now, a new echo in his heart was born,

<p>
Of felon faces, ere he was aware

<p>
From a compress'd unmurmuring lip, it broke,
</p>
<p>

O Lamb of God!

If still unquell'd Despair

<p>
Thrust up a rebel standard, down it fell

At the o'er-powering sigh,

And ere upon his pallet low, he sank,

Like the taught lesson of a humbled child.

Yet duly as the silver vested moon

<p>
Hiding awhile in the dark breast of night

<p>
Return'd to take her regent watch again

<p>
Over our sleeping planet, softly came
</p>
<p>
That shrouded visitant, preferring still
</p>
<p>
Like those who guard us lest we dash our foot
</p>
<p>
Against a stone, to do her blessed work
</p>
<p>
Unseen. And with the liberal gifts she brought
</p>
<p>
For body, and for soul, there seem'd to float
</p>
<p>
A legacy of holy themes and thoughts
</p>
<p>
Behind her, like an incense-stream. He mused
</p>
<p>
Oft-times of patience, and the dying love
</p>
<p>
Of our dear Lord, nor yet without remorse
</p>
<p>
Of that unsullied Truth which Vice rejects,
</p>
<p>
And God requires.

<p class="i16">
How beautiful is Truth!
</p>
<p>
Her right-lined course, amid the veering curves

<p>
And tangents of the world, her open face

<p>
Seeking communion with the scanning stars,
</p>
<p>
Her grave, severe simplicity of speech
</p>
<p>
Untrammelled by the wiles of rhetoric,
</p>
<p>
By bribes of popular applause unbow'd,
</p>
<p>
In unison with Him she dwells who ruled
</p>
<p>
The tyranny of Chaos, with the words
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>Let there be light!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Gladly we turn again
</p>
<p>
To that fair mansion mid the rural vales

Where first our song awoke. Advancing years

Brought to its blessed Lady no regret
</p>
<p>
Or weak complaint for what the hand of Time
</p>
<p>
Had borne away. Enduring charms were hers
</p>
<p>
On which he laid no tax; the beaming smile,
</p>
<p>
The voice of melody, the hand that mark'd
</p>
<p>
Each day with deeds of goodness, and the heart
</p>
<p>
That made God's gift of life more beautiful,
</p>
<p>
The more prolong'd. Its griefs she counted gains,
</p>
<p>
Since He who wisely will'd them cannot err,
</p>
<p>
And loves while He afflicts.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Their dialect
</p>
<p>
Was breathed in secret 'tween her soul and Him.
</p>
<p>
But toward mankind, her duties made more pure

<p>
By the strong heat of their refining fires,
</p>
<p>
Flow'd forth like molten gold. She sought the poor,
</p>
<p>
Counsell'd the ignorant, consoled the sad,
</p>
<p>
And made the happy happier, by her warmth
</p>
<p>
Of social sympathy. She loved to draw
</p>
<p>
The young around her table; well she knew
</p>
<p>
To cheer and teach them, by the tale or song,
</p>
<p>
Or sacred hymn, for music dwelt with her
</p>
<p>
Till life went out. It pleased her much to hear
</p>
<p>
Their innocent merriment, while from the flow
</p>
<p>
And swelling happiness of childhood's heart
</p>
<p>
So simply purchased, she herself imbibed
</p>
<p>
A fuller tide of fresh vitality.
</p>
<p>
Her favor'd guests exultingly rehears'd
</p>
<p>
Their visits to &#34;the Lady,&#34; counting each
</p>
<p>
A privilege, not having learned the creed
</p>
<p>
Which modern times inculcate in our land

Mother and daughter, in sweet fellowship,

One soul betwixt them. Filial piety

Thrives best with generous natures. Here was nought

Like the life-tree, that yieldeth every month

New fruits, still hiding mid its wealth of leaves

<p>
The balm of healing.

For Love to write on. Sporting 'mid the flowers,

<p>
Caroling with the birds, or gliding light

As fawn, her fine, elastic temperament

Took happiest coloring from each varying hour

Or changing duty. Kind, providing cares

Which younglings often thoughtlessly receive

Or thankless claim, she gratefully repaid

With glad obedience. Pleas'd was she to bear

<p>
Precocious part in household industry,

<p>
Round shining bars to involve the shortening thread,

And see the stocking grow, or side by side

With her loved benefactresses to work
</p>
<p>
Upon some garment for the ill-clad poor,
</p>
<p>
With busy needle. As their almoner,

'Twas her delight to seek some lowly hut

<p>
With her kind dole, a wonder whence it came.

The adopted orphanage.

Oh ye whose homes

<p>
Of the frail Crocus through its snowy sheath,
</p>
<p>
On, to the ripen'd gatherings of the Grape,
</p>
<p>
And thorn-clad chestnut, all was sweet to her.
</p>
<p>
She loved to plant the seed and watch the germ,
</p>
<p>
And nurse the tender leaflet like a babe,
</p>
<p>
And lead the tendril right. To her they seem'd
</p>
<p>
Like living friends. She sedulously mark'd
</p>
<p>
Their health and order, and was skill'd to prune
</p>
<p>
The too luxuriant spray, or gadding vine.
</p>
<p>
She taught the blushing Strawberry where to run,
</p>
<p>
And stoop'd to kiss the timid Violet,
</p>
<p>
Blossoming in the shade, and sometimes dream'd
</p>
<p>
The Lily of the lakelet, calmly throned

<p>
On its broad leaf, like Moses in his ark,
</p>
<p>
Spake words to her. And so, as years fled by,
</p>
<p>
Young Fancy, train'd by Nature, turn'd to God.

The antique candelabra shed fair light
</p>
<p>
On polished wainscot and rich curtains dropp'd
</p>
<p>
Close o'er the casements, she might draw her seat
</p>
<p>
Near to her aged friend and take her hand
</p>
<p>
And frame her voice to join some tuneful song,
</p>
<p>
Treasuring whate'er of wise remark distill'd
</p>
<p>
From those loved lips.

Then, as her Mentor spoke

And how we ought to yield it back with trust

And not with dread, whenever He should call,
</p>
<p>
Having such precious promises, through Christ
</p>
<p>
Of gain unspeakable, beyond the grave,

The listening pupil felt her heart expand

Friendship, 'tween youth and age

<p>
And twine themselves around the unfrosted locks,
</p>
<p>
A fadeless coronet. In this sweet home
</p>
<p>
The lengthen'd day seem'd short for their delights,
</p>
<p>
And wintry evening brief. The historic page
</p>
<p>
Made vocal, brought large wealth to memory.
</p>
<p>
The lore of distant climes, that rose and fell
</p>
<p>
Ere our New World, like Lazarus came forth,
</p>
<p>
The napkin round her forehead, and sate down
</p>
<p>
Beside her startled sisters.

Last of all,

The large time-honor'd Bible loos'd its clasps

Then rose the sacred hymn in blended tones,
</p>

By Bertha's parlor-organ made intense

<p>
In melody of praise, and fervent Prayer

Set its pure crown upon the parted day,

And kiss'd the Angel, Sleep.

Yet ere they rose

From bended knee, there was a lingering pause,

But seldom pass'd their lips, though in their hearts

<p>
His image with its faults and sorrows dwelt,

Invoking pity of a pardoning God.

The chill, the change, the anguish, where she dwelt,

Announc'd her agony.

</p>
<p>
Counted its strokes, a stroke for every year,
</p>
<p>
And predicated thence, as best they might,
</p>
<p>
Whom they had lost. Neighbor of neighbor ask'd,

&#8212;A village funeral is a thing that warns
</p>
<p>
All from their homes. In the throng'd city's bound,
</p>
<p>
Hearses unnoticed pass, and none inquire
</p>
<p>
Who goeth to his grave. But rural life
</p>
<p>
Keepeth afresh the rills of sympathy.
</p>
<p>
True sorrow was there at these obsequies,
</p>
<p>
For all the poor were mourners. There the old
</p>
<p>
Came in the garments she had given, bow'd down
</p>
<p>
With their own sense of loss. O'er furrow'd cheeks
</p>
<p>
In care-worn channels stole the trickling tear.
</p>
<p>
The young were weepers, for their memories stored
</p>
<p>
Many a gentle word, and precept kind,
</p>
<p>
Like jewels dropp'd behind her. Mothers rais'd
</p>
<p>
Their little ones above the coffin's side
</p>
<p>
To look upon her face. Lingering they gazed

Deeming the lovely Lady sweetly slept

By hopeless grief. Doubt not her watchful eye

<p>
To make God's will our own. You, who were glad

To do her bidding then, distress her not

If faithful found, with Her who went before

And beckoning waits us.&#34;

By kind reproof awakened, Leonore

Within
</p>
<p>
The limits of a neighboring town, a wretch
</p>
<p>
Fell by the wayside, struck by sudden Death
</p>
<p>
That vice propels. A Man of God, who sought
</p>
<p>
Like his blest Master every form of woe
</p>
<p>
Found him, and to a shelter and a couch
</p>
<p>
Convey'd. Then bending down, with earnest words
</p>
<p>
For time grew short, he urg'd him to repent.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Say, Lord have mercy on my soul.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Look up
</p>
<p>
Unto the Lamb of God, for He can save
</p>
<p>
Even to the uttermost.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Slight heed obtain'd
</p>
<p>
This adjuration, wild the glazing eye
</p>
<p>
Fix'd on the wall,&#8212;and ever and anon
</p>
<p>
The stiffening fingers clutch'd at things unseen,
</p>
<p>
While from those spent lungs came a shuddering sound,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>That's he! That's he!</i>
</p>
<p class="i16">
<i>
The old man! His grey hairs</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Dabbled with blood!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Then in a loud, long cry,
</p>
<p>
Wrung out by torturing pain,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;I struck the blow!
</p>
<p>
I tell ye that I struck the blow, and scaped.
</p>
<p>
Conrad who bore the doom is innocent,
</p>
<p>
Save fellowship with guilt.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
And so he fled;
</p>
<p>
The voice of prayer around him, but the soul
</p>
<p>
Beyond its reach. The kneeling Pastor rose
</p>
<p>
Sadly, as when the Shepherd fails to snatch
</p>
<p>
A wanderer from the Lion.
</p>
<p class="i16">
But the truth
</p>
<p>
Couch'd in that dismal cry of parting life
</p>
<p>
He treasured up, and bore to those who held
</p>
<p>
Power to investigate and to reprieve;
</p>
<p>
And authorized by them with gladness sought
</p>
<p>
The gloomy prison. Conrad there he found
</p>
<p>
In sullen syncope of sickening thought,
</p>
<p>
And cautiously in measured terms disclosed
</p>
<p>
His liberation. Wondering doubt look'd forth
</p>
<p>
From eyes that opening wide and wider still
</p>
<p>
Strain'd from their sockets. Yet the hand he took
</p>
<p>
That led him from the cell, and onward moved
</p>
<p>
Like Peter following his angel guide
</p>
<p>
Deeming he saw a vision. As the bolts
</p>
<p>
Drew gratingly to let them pass, he seem'd
</p>
<p>
To gather consciousness, and restless grew
</p>
<p>
With an unspoken fear, lest at the last
</p>
<p>
Some sterner turnkey, or gruff sentinel
</p>
<p>
Might bar their egress.
</p>
<p class="i16">
When behind them closed.
</p>
<p>
The utmost barrier, and the sweet, fresh air
</p>
<p>
So long witheld, fill'd his collapsing lungs,
</p>
<p>
He shouted rapturously,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;<i>Am I alive?</i>
</p>
<p>
Or have I burst the gates of death, and found
</p>
<p>
A second Eden?&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
The unwonted sound
</p>
<p>
Of his own voice, freed from the drear constraint
</p>
<p>
Of prison durance, swell'd his thrilling frame
</p>
<p>
With strong and joyous impulse, for 'tis said
</p>
<p>
Long stifled utterance is torturing pain
</p>
<p>
To organs train'd to speech.
</p>
<p class="i16">
With one high leap
</p>
<p>
Like an enfranchis'd steed he seem'd to throw
</p>
<p>
His spirit-chain behind him. Then he took
</p>
<p>
The Pastor's offer'd arm, who led the way
</p>
<p>
To his own house, and bade him bathe and change
</p>
<p>
His prison garments, and repose that night
</p>
<p>
Under his roof.
</p>
<p class="i16">
With thoughtful care he spoke
</p>
<p>
To his own household, kindly to receive
</p>
<p>
The erring one,&#8212;&#34;for we are sinners all,
</p>
<p>
And not upon our merits may depend
</p>
<p>
But on abounding grace.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
So when the hour
</p>
<p>
Of cheerful supper summon'd to the board,
</p>
<p>
He came among them as a comely guest,
</p>
<p>
Refresh'd and welcome. Pleasant converse cheer'd
</p>
<p>
The hospitable meal, and then withdrawn
</p>
<p>
Into the quiet study 'mid the books,
</p>
<p>
That saintly good man with the hoary hair
</p>
<p>
Silvering his temples like a graceful crown,
</p>
<p>
Strove by wise counsel to encourage him
</p>
<p>
For life's important duties,
</p>
<p class="i16">
But he deem'd
</p>
<p>
A ban was on him, and a mark which all
</p>
<p>
Would scan who met him.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;He whose lot hath been
</p>
<p>
With fiends in Pandemonium, must expect
</p>
<p>
Hate and contempt from men.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Not so, my son!
</p>
<p>
Wipe off the past, as a forgotten thing,
</p>
<p>
Propitiate virtue, by forsaking vice.
</p>
<p>
The good will aid you, and a brighter day
</p>
<p>
Doubtless awaits you. Be not too much moved
</p>
<p>
By man's applause or blame, but ever look
</p>
<p>
Unto a higher Judge.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Then there arose
</p>
<p>
A voice of supplication, so intense
</p>
<p>
To the Great Pardoner, that He would send
</p>
<p>
His spirit down to change and purify
</p>
<p>
The erring heart, that those persuasive tones,
</p>
<p>
So humble, yet so strangely eloquent
</p>
<p>
Breathed o'er the unhappy one like soothing spell
</p>
<p>
Of magic influence, and he slept that night
</p>
<p>
With peace and hope, long exiled from his couch.
</p>
</div>

A summer drive to one sequestered long,
</p>
<p>
Hath charms untold.
</p>
<p class="i16">
The common face of earth,
</p>
<p>
The waving grass, the rustle of the leaves,
</p>
<p>
Kiss'd by the zephyr, or by winged bird
</p>
<p>
Disparted, as it finds its chirping nest,
</p>
<p>
The murmur of the brooks, the low of herds,
</p>
<p>
The ever-changing landscape, rock and stream,
</p>
<p>
And azure concave fleck'd with silver clouds
</p>
<p>
Awaken rapturous joy. This Conrad felt,
</p>
<p>
While pleasure every kindling feature touch'd,
</p>
<p>
And every accent tuned. But when they saw
</p>
<p>
The fair ancestral roof through trees afar,
</p>
<p>
Strong agony convuls'd him, and he cried,
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>Not there! Not there!</i>
</p>
<p class="i16">
First take me to
<i>
Her
</i>
grave!&#34;
</p>
<p>
And so to that secluded spot they turn'd,
</p>
<p>
Where rest the silent dead.
</p>
<p class="i16">
On the green mound,
</p>
<p>
His Mother's bed, with sobs and groans he fell,
</p>
<p>
And in his paroxysm of grief would fain
</p>
<p>
Have torn the turf-bound earth away, to reach
</p>
<p>
The mouldering coffin. Then, a flood of tears,
</p>
<p>
Heaven's blessed gift burst forth,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Oh weep, my Son!
</p>
<p>
These gushing tears shall help to wash away
</p>
<p>
Remorseful pangs, and lurking seeds of sin.
</p>
<p>
Here, in this sacred tomb, bury the past,
</p>
<p>
And strong in heavenly trust, resolve to rise
</p>
<p>
To a new life.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Still kneeling on the sod
</p>
<p>
With hands and eyes uprais'd, he said,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;<i>I will!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
So help me God!</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
The tear was on his cheek
</p>
<p>
Undry'd, when to the home of peace they came.
</p>
<p>
There Bertha greeted them with outstretch'd hands
</p>
<p>
And beaming brow, while the good Pastor said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Thy Son was dead, but is alive again.&#34;
</p>
<p>
A sweet voice answer'd,
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Lost he was, and found!
</p>
<p>
Oh, welcome home.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
She would have folded him
</p>
<p>
In her embrace. But at her feet he fell,
</p>
<p>
Clasping her knees, and bowing down his head,
</p>
<p>
Till she assured him that a mother's love
</p>
<p>
Was in her heart.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;And there is joy in Heaven

<p>
Because of him, this day,&#34; the good Man said.

&#8212;His tones were tremulous, as up he rose,

<p>
Soften'd the spirit. There, in tones subdued
</p>
<p>
By strong emotion, he disclosed his love
</p>
<p>
For Leonore.
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Oh Conrad! she is pure
</p>
<p>
And peaceful as the lily bud that sleeps
</p>
<p>
On the heaven-mirror'd lake.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;I know it well,
</p>
<p>
Nor would I wake a ripple or a breath
</p>
<p>
To mar its purity.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Yet wait, my Son!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>Wait? Mother, wait! It is not in man's heart</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
To love, and wait?</i>&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;But make your prayer to God.
</p>
<p>
Lay your petition at his feet, and see
</p>
<p>
What is His will.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
&#34;Before that God I swear
</p>
<p>
To be her true protector and best friend
</p>
<p>
Till death remove me hence, if she confide
</p>
<p>
At fitting time, that holy trust to me.
</p>
<p>
Oh angel Mother! sanction me to search
</p>
<p>
If in her heart there be one answering chord
</p>
<p>
To my great love. So may we lead below
</p>
<p>
That blended life which with a firmer step
</p>
<p>
And holier joy tends upward toward a realm
</p>
<p>
Of perfect bliss.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i16">
Thus authorized, he made
</p>
<p>
Her mind's improvement his delight, and found
</p>
<p>
Community in knowledge was a spell
</p>
<p>
To draw young hearts together. O'er the lore
</p>
<p>
And language of her native land they hung
</p>
<p>
Gleaning its riches with a tireless hand,
</p>
<p>
Deep and enamour'd students. When she sang
</p>
<p>
Or play'd, he join'd her with his silvery flute,
</p>
<p>
Making the thrill of music more intense
</p>
<p>
Through the heart's harmony.
</p>
<p class="i16">
Amid the flowers
</p>
<p>
He met her, and her garden's pleasant toil
</p>
<p>
Shared with a master's hand, for well he knew
</p>
<p>
The nature and the welfare of the plants
</p>
<p>
That most she prized. They loved the umbrageous trees,
</p>
<p>
And in their strong, columnar trunks beheld
</p>
<p>
The Almighty Architect, and for His sake
</p>
<p>
Paid them respect.
</p>
<p class="i16">
At the soft twilight hour,
</p>
<p>
He sate beside her silently, and watch'd
</p>
<p>
The pensive lustre of her lifted eye,
</p>
<p>
Intent to welcome the first star that hung
</p>
<p>
Its holy cresset forth. Unconsciously
</p>
<p>
Her moods of lonely musing stole away,
</p>
<p>
And his endear'd society became
</p>
<p>
Part of her being.
</p>
<p class="i16">
In her soul was nought
</p>
<p>
Of vanity, or coquetry to bar
</p>
<p>
That heaven-imparted sentiment which makes
</p>
<p>
All hope, all thought, all self, subordinate
</p>
<p>
Unto another's weal, while life shall last.

One morn, the orphan sought the private ear

Of her kind benefactress.
</p>
<p class="i16">
In low tones

With the sweet modesty of innocence,
</p>
<p>
She told that Conrad offered her his heart,

<p>
Entreated counsel from her changeless friend.

Of Him, who gives ability to make

In library or boudoir, and seduce

The school-girl from her sleep, and lessons too.

But I no tint of romance have to throw

And the coming years

REV. DR. T. M. COOLEY,

</p>
<p class="head">
For more than sixty years Pastor of one Church in East Granville, Mass., died there in 1859, aged 83.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Not in the pulpit where he joy'd to bear
</p>
<p>
The message of salvation, not beside
</p>
<p>
His study-lamp, nor in the fireside chair,
</p>
<p>
Encircled by those dearest ones who found
</p>
<p>
In him their life of life, nor in the homes
</p>
<p>
Of his beloved flock, sharing with them
</p>
<p>
All sympathies of sorrow or of joy,
</p>
<p>
Is seen the faithful Shepherd.
</p>
<p class="i18">
He hath gone
</p>
<p>
To yon blest Country where he long'd to be,
</p>
<p>
To stand before the Great White Throne, and join
</p>
<p>
That hymn of praise for which his course below
</p>
<p>
Gave preparation.
</p>
<p class="i18">
At one post he stood
</p>
<p>
From youth till fourscore years, averse to change
</p>
<p>
Though oft-times tempted. For he did not deem
</p>
<p>
Restless ambition or desire of gold
</p>
<p>
Fit counterpoise for that most sacred love
</p>
<p>
Born in the inner chambers of the soul,
</p>
<p>
And intertwining with a golden mesh
</p>
<p>
Pastor and people.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Like some lofty tree
</p>
<p>
Whose untransplanted roots in freshness meet
</p>
<p>
The living waters, and whose leaf is green
</p>
<p>
'Mid winter's gather'd frost, serene he stood,
</p>
<p>
More fondly honor'd for each added year,
</p>
<p>
While 'neath his shadow drew with reverent love
</p>
<p>
Successive generations.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">
Hoary Time
</p>
<p>
Linger'd with blessings for his latest day,
</p>
<p>
And now 'neath turf embalm'd with tears he sleeps,
</p>
<p>
Waiting the resurrection of the just.

<p>
When the good mother dieth, and the home
</p>
<p>
So long made happy by her boundless love
</p>
<p>
Is desolate and empty, there are tears
</p>
<p>
Of filial anguish, not to be represt;
</p>
<p>
And when the many friends who at her side
</p>
<p>
Sought social sympathy and counsel sweet,
</p>
<p>
Or the sad poor, who, for their Saviour's sake,
</p>
<p>
Found bountiful relief, and kind regard,
</p>
<p>
Stand at that altered threshold, and perceive
</p>
<p>
Faces of strangers from her casement look,
</p>
<p>
There is a pang not to be told in words.
</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet, when the christian, having well discharged
</p>

<p>
May follow, should there not be

<p class="i18">
Thus it is even now&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Tears with the triumph-strain;
</p>
<p class="i18">
For we are made
</p>
<p>
Of flesh as well as spirit, and are taught

<p>
And with strong contrast deepening truths divine.

<p>
But unto thee, dear friend, whose breath was prayer,

<p>
And o'er whose mortal sickness hovering Faith

<p>
Shed heaven's content, there was no further need
</p>
<p>
Of tutelage like that by which we learn,
</p>
<p>
Too slow, perchance, with vacillating minds,
</p>
<p>
What the disciples of our Lord should be;
</p>
<p>
For when the subjugation to God's will
</p>
<p>
Is perfect, and affliction all disarmed,
</p>
<p>
Is not life's lesson done?

Life's work well done, how beautiful to rest.

Aye, lift your little ones to see her face,

<p>
There is no wrinkle there,&#8212;no rigid gloom

A course like this, predicted close serene,

Whose life was duty, and whose death was peace.

From where Virginia's health-reviving springs

The dark-winged angel who doth come but once,

Troubled the waters, and his latest breath

Fled, where his first was drawn.

<p class="i18">
That noble brow

So mark'd with intellect, so clear with truth,

Grave in its goodness, in its love serene,

That earnest voice

Filling the Temple-arch so gloriously,

Enforced by power of fervid eloquence

<p>
No element of self, but hand in hand

Walk'd with humility. He needeth not

A pleasant theme it is to think of him

<p>
That parted friend, whose noble heart and mind

Were ever active to the highest ends.

<p>
Even sceptics paid him homage 'mid their doubts,

Perceiving that his life made evident

<p class="i18">
An upright man, who scorn'd

<p>
All subterfuge, who faithful to his trust

Guarded the interests they so highly prized,

With power and zeal unchang'd, from youth to age.

Yet there's a sadder sound of bursting tears

From woe-worn helpless ones, from widow'd forms

O'er whom he threw a shelter, for his name

Long mingled with their prayers, both night and morn.
</p>
<p>
The Missionary toward the setting sun
</p>
<p>
Will miss his liberal hand that threw so wide

<p>
Its secret alms. The sons of want will miss
</p>
<p>
His noble presence moving thro' our streets
</p>
<p>
Intent on generous deeds; and in the Church
</p>
<p>
He loved so well, a silence and a chasm

<p>
Are where the fervent and responsive voice,
</p>
<p>
And kingly beauty of the hoary head

<p>
So long maintained their place.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Sudden he sank,
</p>
<p>
Though not unwarn'd.
</p>
<p class="i18">
A chosen band had kept
</p>
<p>
Watch through the night, and earnest love took note

<p>
Of every breath. But when approaching dawn
</p>
<p>
Kindled the east, and from the trees that bowered
</p>
<p>
His beautiful abode, awakening birds
</p>
<p>
Sent up their earliest carol, he went forth
</p>
<p>
To meet the glories of the unsetting sun,
</p>
<p>
And hear with unseal'd ear the song of heaven.

The soul that had gone home unto its God.

</p>
<p class="head">
Died at Hartford, April 30th, 1861, aged 22.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw a brilliant bridal.
</p>
<p class="i18">
All that cheers
</p>
<p>
And charms the leaping heart of youth was there;
</p>
<p>
And she, the central object of the group,
</p>
<p>
The cherished song-bird of her father's house,
</p>
<p>
Array'd in beauty, was the loved of all.
</p>
<p>
Would I could tell you what a world of flowers
</p>
<p>
Were concentrated there&#8212;how they o'erflow'd
</p>
<p>
In wreaths and clusters&#8212;how they climb'd and swept
</p>
<p>
From vase to ceiling, with their gay festoons
</p>
<p>
Whispering each other in their mystic lore
</p>
<p>
Of fragrance, and consulting how to swell,
</p>
<p>
As best they might, the tide of happiness.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A few brief moons departed and I sought
</p>
<p>
The same abode. There was a gather'd throng
</p>
<p>
Beyond the threshold stone. A few white flowers
</p>
<p>
Crept o'er a bosom and a gentle hand
</p>
<p>
That clasp'd them not. A holy hymn awoke
</p>
<p>
In plaintive melody; but she who breath'd
</p>
<p>
The very soul of music from her birth,
</p>
<p>
Lay there with close-seal'd lips.
</p>
<p class="i18">
And the same voice
</p>
<p>
That in the flushing of the autumnal rose
</p>
<p>
Gladly pronounced the irrevocable words
</p>
<p>
&#34;<i>What God hath join'd together let no man</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Asunder put</i>,&#34; now, in the chasten'd tones
</p>
<p>
Of deep humility and tenderness,
</p>
<p>
Strove, from the armory of Heaven, to gird
</p>
<p>
The hearts that freshly bled.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">
At close of day,
</p>
<p>
In the lone, sadden'd hour of musing thought,
</p>
<p>
I seem'd to view a scene where, side by side,
</p>
<p>
Bridals and burials gleam'd&#8212;the smile and tear&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Anguish and joy&#8212;peace in her heavenly vest,
</p>
<p>
And brazen-throated war&#8212;and heard a cry,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Such is man's life below.&#34;
</p>
<p class="i18">
I would have wept,
</p>
<p>
Save that a symphony of harps unseen
</p>
<p>
Broke from a hovering cloud; &#34;Lo! we are they
</p>
<p>
Who from earth's tribulation rose and found
</p>
<p>
Our robes made white. Henceforth we grieve no more.&#34;

</p>
<p>
Stood near in her extremity, and gave
</p>
<p>
Her soul full willingness to leave a world

<p>
All bright with beauty, and requited love.

MRS. HARVEY SEYMOUR,
</a>
</p>
<p class="head">
Died at Hartford, Sunday, May 5th, 1861.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She found a painless avenue to make
</p>
<p>
The great transition from a world of care
</p>
<p>
To one of rest.
</p>
<p class="i18">
It was the Sabbath day,
</p>
<p>
And beautiful with smile of vernal sun
</p>
<p>
And the up-springing fragrance from the earth,
</p>
<p>
With all that soothing quietude which links
</p>
<p>
The consecrated season unto Him
</p>
<p>
Who bade the creatures He had made, revere
</p>
<p>
And keep it holy.
</p>
<p class="i18">
From her fair abode,
</p>
<p>
Lovely with early flowers, she took her way
</p>
<p>
The second time, unto the House of God,
</p>
<p>
And side by side with her life's chosen friend
</p>
<p>
Walk'd cheerfully. Within those hallow'd courts,
</p>
<p>
Where holds the soul communion with its God,
</p>
<p>
She listening sate.
</p>
<p class="i18">
But then she lean'd her head
</p>
<p>
Upon her husband's shoulder, and unmark'd
</p>
<p>
By one distorted feature, by the loss
</p>
<p>
Or blanching of the rose-tint on her cheek,
</p>
<p>
Rose to more perfect worship.
</p>
<p class="i18">
It might seem
</p>
<p>
As if a sacred temple, purified
</p>
<p>
By prayers and praises, were a place sublime,
</p>
<p>
Of fitting sanctity, wherein to hear
</p>
<p>
The inexpressive call that summoneth
</p>
<p>
The ready spirit upward.
</p>
<p class="i18">
But the change
</p>
<p>
In her delightful home, what words can tell!
</p>
<p>
The shock and contrast, when a mind so skill'd
</p>
<p>
With order and efficiency to fill
</p>
<p>
Each post of woman's duty and of love,
</p>
<p>
Vanished from all its daily ministries,
</p>
<p>
And the lone daughter found the guiding voice
</p>
<p>
Silent forevermore.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Her's was the heart
</p>
<p>
For an unswerving friendship, warm and true,
</p>
<p>
And self-forgetful; her's the liberal hand
</p>
<p>
To those who pine in cells of poverty,
</p>
<p>
The knowledge of their state, the will to aid,
</p>
<p>
The thought that cared for them, the zeal that blest.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Hence, tears o'er rugged cheeks fell fast for her,
</p>
<p>
And the old white-hair'd pensioner knelt down
</p>
<p>
Beside her lifeless clay and cross'd himself,
</p>
<p>
And pour'd his desolate prayer; for her kind heart
</p>
<p>
Saw in the creed of varying sects no bar
</p>
<p>
To charity, but in their time of need
</p>
<p>
Held all as brethren.
</p>
<p class="i18">
'Twas a pleasant spot,
</p>
<p>
Amid fresh verdure, where they laid her down,
</p>
<p>
While the young plants that o'er a daughter's grave
</p>
<p>
Took summer-rooting seemed in haste to reach
</p>
<p>
Forth their incipient roots and tendrils green
</p>
<p>
To broider her turf-pillow.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Sleep in peace,
</p>
<p>
Ye, whom the ties of nature closely bound,
</p>
<p>
And death disparted for a little while,
</p>
<p>
Mother and gentle daughter, sleep in peace;
</p>
<p>
Your forms engraven deep on loving hearts,
</p>
<p>
As with a diamond's point, till memory fade.

&#8212;His was the type of character that makes

<p>
A dignity of mind that mark'd unmov'd

The unsought honors clustering round his path,

And chang'd them into duties. With firm step

Serving his Country, not to share her spoils,

Unostentatious channels, and he loved

Aiding their oar against opposing tides,

Home?&#8212;Yes! Give thanks, ye, who still travel on,

Of such example as she set us here,

Hers was a life that bore

The test of scrutiny, and they who saw

Its inner ministration, day by day,

Bore fullest witness to its symmetry,

Its delicate tissues, and unwavering crown

Of piety. A heritage of fame,

And the rich culture of her early years

<p>
Wrought no contempt for woman's household care,

But gave it dignity. Order was hers,

<p>
And system, and an industry that weighed

<p>
The priceless value of each fleeting hour.

Hers was a charm of manner felt by all,

Wondering beheld his place at church unfill'd,

The curtains of his tent were gently raised

COLONEL H. L. MILLER,

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sorrow and Joy collude. One mansion hears
</p>
<p>
The children shouting o'er their Christmas Tree,
</p>
<p>
While in the next resound the widow's wail
</p>
<p>
And weeping of the fatherless. So walk
</p>
<p>
Sickness and health. One rounds the cheek at morn,
</p>
<p>
The other with a ghost-like movement glides
</p>
<p>
Unto the nightly couch, and lo! the wheels
</p>
<p>
Of life drive heavily, and all its springs
</p>
<p>
Revolving in mysterious mechanism
</p>
<p>
Are troubled.
</p>
<p class="i18">
And how slight the instrument
</p>
<p>
That sometimes sends the strong man to his tomb,
</p>
<p>
Revealing that the glory of his prime,
</p>
<p>
Is as the flower of grass.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">
Of this we thought
</p>
<p>
When looking on the face that lay so calm
</p>
<p>
And comely in its narrow coffin-bed,
</p>
<p>
Remembering how the months of pain that sank
</p>
<p>
His manly vigor to an infant's sigh
</p>
<p>
Were met unmurmuringly.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Dense was the throng
</p>
<p>
That gather'd to his obsequies,&#8212;and well
</p>
<p>
The Pastor's prayer of faith essayed to gird
</p>
<p>
The smitten hearts that whelm'd in sorrow mourn'd
</p>
<p>
Husband and sire, whose ever-watchful love
</p>
<p>
Guarded their happiness.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">
Slowly moved on
</p>
<p>
The long procession, led by martial men
</p>
<p>
Who deeply in their patriot minds deplored
</p>
<p>
Their fallen compeer, and bade music lay
</p>
<p>
With plaintive voice, her chaplet down beside
</p>
<p>
His open grave.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Then, the first setting sun
</p>
<p>
Of our New-Year, cast off his wintry frown,
</p>
<p>
And seemed to write in clear, long lines of gold
</p>
<p>
Upon the whiten'd earth, the glorious words,
</p>
<p>
So shall the dead arise, at the last trump,
</p>
<p>
Sown here in weakness, to be raised in power,
</p>
<p>
Sown in corruption, to put on the robes
</p>
<p>
Of immortality.
</p>
<p class="i18">
Praise be to Him
</p>
<p>
Who gives through Christ our Lord, to dying flesh

<p>
Such victory.

</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We choose those unobtrusive traits
</p>
<p class="i2">
That dawn'd with influence mild,
</p>
<p>
When in his noble Mother's arms
</p>
<p class="i2">
We saw the noble child,

<p>
And noted mid the changeful scenes

<p class="i2">
Of boyhood's sport or strife,

<p>
That quiet, firm and ruling mind

<p class="i2">
Which marked advancing life.

</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So onward as he held his course

Through hardship to renown,

<p>
He kept fresh sympathy for those

Who cope with fortune's frown,

<p>
The kind regard for honest toil,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The joy to see it rise,

<p class="i2">
His frailties to disguise,

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The lofty mind that all alone

<p class="i2">
Gigantic plans sustain'd,

<p>
Yet turned unboastfully away

<p class="i2">
From fame and honors gained;

The tender love for her who blest

<p class="i2">
His home with angel-care,

For in the glory of his prime

The daily bread he gave,

MADAM HANNAH LATHROP,

</p>
<p class="head">
Died in Norwich, Connecticut, January 18th, 1862, aged 92.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Had I an artist's pencil, I might sketch
</p>
<p>
Her as she was, in her young matronhood

<p>
Graceful and dignified, serene and fair.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#8212;I well remember, when at Sabbath-morn,
</p>
<p>
With pious zeal, the rural church she sought,
</p>
<p>
Our rural church,&#8212;by rocks o'er-canopied,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Where with her stately husband and their group
</p>
<p>
Of younglings bright, each in the accustom'd seat,
</p>
<p>
How many a glance was toward her beauty bent
</p>
<p>
Admiringly.
</p>
<p class="i18">
In those primeval days
</p>
<p>
The aristocracy that won respect,
</p>
<p>
Sprang not from wealth alone, but laid its base
</p>
<p>
In goodness and in virtue. Thus she held
</p>
<p>
Her healthful influence in society
</p>
<p>
Without gainsaying voice.
</p>
<p class="i18">
The polity
</p>
<p>
Of woman's realm,&#8212;sweet home,&#8212;those inner cares
</p>
<p>
And countless details that promote its peace,
</p>
<p>
Prosperity and order, were not deem'd
</p>
<p>
Beneath the highest then, nor wholly left
</p>
<p>
To hireling hands. This science she upheld,
</p>
<p>
And with her circle of accomplishments
</p>
<p>
And charms so mingled it, that all combined
</p>
<p>
Harmoniously.
</p>
<p class="i18">
That energy and grace
</p>
<p>
So often deem'd the exclusive property
</p>
<p>
Of youth's fresh season, or of vigorous prime,
</p>
<p>
She brought to Age, an unencumbered dower,
</p>
<p>
Making the gift of being beautiful,
</p>
<p>
Even beyond ninety years.
</p>
<p class="i18">
And though the change
</p>
<p>
Of mortal life, dispers'd her cherish'd band,
</p>
<p>
And some had gone their own fair nests to build
</p>
<p>
And some arisen to mansions in the skies
</p>
<p>
Alone, yet undismay'd, her post she kept,
</p>
<p>
Guiding a household in the same good ways
</p>
<p>
Of order and of hospitality.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
So, when with mild decline, the sunset came,
</p>
<p>
Her powers still unimpair'd, all willingly
</p>
<p>
As a confiding and obedient child
</p>
<p>
Goes to its father's house, she went above.

RICHARD ELY COLLINS,

</p>
<p class="head">
Son of Mr.
<span class="sc">
Morris Collins</span>, died at Wethersfield, September 5th, 1862, aged 3 months and 27 days.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It was a sad and lovely sight
</p>
<p class="i2">
They call'd us to behold,
</p>
<p>
That infant forehead high and fair,
</p>
<p>
Those beauteous features sculptured rare,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet breathless all, and cold.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Heard it in dreams, an angel voice
</p>
<p class="i2">
Soft as the zephyr's tone?
</p>
<p>
The yearning of a Mother mild
</p>
<p>
To clasp once more her three months' child
</p>
<p class="i2">
But a few days her own?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Just a few days of wasting pain
</p>
<p class="i2">
She linger'd by its side,
</p>
<p>
And then consign'd to stranger arms
</p>
<p>
The frail unfolding of the charms
</p>
<p class="i2">
She would have watch'd with pride.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet happy babe! to reach a home
</p>
<p class="i2">
Beyond all sorrowing cares,
</p>
<p>
Where none a Mother's loss can moan
</p>
<p>
Or seek for bread, and find a stone,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Or fall in fatal snares.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Thrice happy,&#8212;to have pass'd away
</p>
<p class="i2">
Ere Time's sore ills invade,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
From fragrant buds that drooping shed
</p>
<p>
Their life-sigh o'er thy coffin-bed&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
To flowers that never fade.

</p>
<p class="head">
Died at Hartford, September 28th, 1862.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We miss her at the chancel-side,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For when we last drew near,
</p>
<p>
The holy Eucharist to share,
</p>
<p>
She, with the warmth of praise and prayer
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was meekly kneeling here.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

Relieves a thirsting soil,

<p>
And when the Blessed Church demands
</p>
<p>
Assistance for the mission bands

<p class="i2">
That on her frontier toil.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">

<p class="i2">

young and poor,
</p>
<p>
Whom year by year she deign'd to teach

<p>
With faithful zeal and patient speech,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And hope that anchor'd sure.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her couch is in the ancestral tomb
</p>
<p class="i2">
With Putnam's honor'd dust,
</p>
<p>
The true in word, the bold in deed,
</p>
<p>
A bulwark in his Country's need,

<p class="i2">
A tower of strength and trust.

<div class="poem">

Her spirit's home is with her Lord,

Whom from her youth she sought,

The miss'd below hath found above

<p>
The promise of a God of Love

<p class="i2">
Made to the pure in thought.

MR. JOHN A. TAINTOR,
</a>
</p>
<p class="head">
Died at Hartford, on Saturday Evening, November 15th, 1862, aged 62 years.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A sense of loss is on us. One hath gone
</p>
<p class="i2">
Whose all-pervading energy doth leave
</p>
<p>
A void and silence 'mid the haunts of men
</p>
<p class="i2">
And desolation for the hearts that grieve
</p>
<p>
In his fair mansion, so bereft and lone,
</p>
<p>
Whence the inspiring smile, and cheering voice have flown.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Those too there are who eloquently speak
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of his firm friendship, not without a tear,
</p>
<p>
Of its strong power to undergird the weak
</p>
<p class="i2">
And hold the faltering feet in duty's sphere,
</p>
<p>
While in the cells of want, a broken trust
</p>
<p>
In bitterness laments, that he is of the dust.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In foreign climes, with patriotic eye
</p>
<p class="i2">
He sought what might his Country's welfare aid,
</p>
<p>
And the rich flocks of Spain, at his behest
</p>
<p class="i2">
Spread their proud fleeces o'er our verdant glade,
</p>
<p>
And Scotia's herds, as on their native shore
</p>
<p>
Our never-failing streams, and pastures rich explore.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Intent was he to adorn his own domain
</p>
<p class="i2">
With all the radiant charms that Flora brings,
</p>
<p>
There still, the green-house flowers pronounce his name,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The favor'd rose its grateful fragrance flings,
</p>
<p>
And in their faithful ranks to guard the scene
</p>
<p>
Like changeless memories rise, the unfading evergreen.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On friendly deeds intent, while on his way
</p>
<p class="i2">
A widow'd heart to cheer,&#8212;<i>One
</i>
grasp'd his hand
</p>
<p>
Whose icy touch the beating heart can stay,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And in a moment, at that stern command
</p>
<p>
Unwarn'd, yet not unready, he doth show
</p>
<p>
The great transition made, that waits on all below.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet, ah! the contrast,&#8212;when the form that pass'd
</p>
<p class="i2">
Forth from its gates, in full vitality,
</p>
<p>
Is homeward, as a lifeless burden borne,
</p>
<p class="i2">
No more to breathe kind word, or fond reply,
</p>
<p>
Each nameless care assume with earnest skill,
</p>
<p>
Nor the unspoken wish of those he loved fulfill.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But hallow'd lips within the sacred dome
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where he so long his sabbath-worship paid
</p>
<p>
Have given his soul to God from whence it came
</p>
<p class="i2">
And laid his head beneath the cypress shade,
</p>
<p>
While &#34;<i>be ye also ready</i>,&#34; from his tomb,
</p>
<p>
In a Redeemer's voice, doth neutralize the gloom.

The 86th Psalm, one of his favorites, as death drew nigh was often read to him by his daughter, who never left him, day or night, during his sickness, and &#34;out of whose arms,&#34; says one who was present, &#34;when he drew his last breath, the angels took him.&#34;

Mrs. Eliza S. Robinson, the only child of Governor and Mrs. Trumbull, whose early life had been a scene of singularly unbroken felicity, was appointed to a fearful contrast of rapid and severe bereavements. Her noble husband, Lucius F. Robinson, Esq., in the midst of his days and usefulness, was suddenly smitten,&#8212;immediately after, their beautiful child, Annie Seymour,&#8212;then her distinguished relative, Chief Justice Storrs, who from her birth had regarded her with a fatherly love; and then both her parents, side by side, almost hand in hand, passed to the tomb.

With unsurpassed calmness, she met this whelming tide of sorrow, girding herself to her maternal duties, in tho armor of a disciple of Jesus Christ. Yet with little warning, she was herself soon summoned to follow those beloved ones, dying in August, 1862, at the age of 35, leaving three orphan daughters, and a large circle of friends to lament the loss of her beautiful example of every christian grace and virtue.

Mr. Ripley was a persevering friend and patron of the State Reform School at West Meriden. He had long sustained the office of Trustee for the County of Hartford, and was at the time of his death, the Chairman of that body, and a prominent member of its Executive Committee. His frequent visits to that Institution, his attention to all its internal concerns, and earnest satisfaction in its prosperity, entitle him to its grateful remembrance.
